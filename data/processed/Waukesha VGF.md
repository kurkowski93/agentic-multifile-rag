## SECTION 1.15

## GENERAL INFORMATION

## INTRODUCTION TO VGF /Ge4 F18/H24 MODELS

Waukesha Engine, Dresser, Inc. manufactures two models of VGF inline engines: the F18 and H24.

TheVGFF18engineisa6cylinder,4- -cycle engine, and has a total cylinder displacement of 18 litres (1096 cubic in.). The F18 bore and stroke is 152 x 165 mm (5.98 x 6.5 in.), and piston speed is 9.9 meters per second (1950 feet per minute) at 1800 rpm.

The VGF H24 engine is a 8 cylinder, 4- -cycle engine, and has a total cylinder displacement of 24 litres (1462 cu. in.). The H24 bore and stroke is 152 x 165 mm (5.98 x 6.5 in.), and piston speed is 9.9 meters per second (1950 feet per minute) at 1800 rpm.

Both the VGF F18 and H24 engines come in G, GL, GL LCR (Low Compression Ratio), GLD or GSID configurations. The GL and GLD models have a compression ratio of 11:1. The GL LCR model has a compression ratio of 8.7:1 and the G/GSID model has a compression ratio of 8.6:1.

The VGF F18/H24 G engine is a non turbocharged rich combustion (stoichiometric) engine that operates on natural gas for reduced emissions.

The VGF F18/H24 GL engine operates on natural gas andis designed to burn a lean air/fuel mixturefor lowfuel consumption and reduced emissions. GL engines are equipped with a turbocharger that 'forces' high velocity ambient air through the intercooler, carburetor and intake manifold, before entering the combustion chamber.

The VGF F18/H24 GLD is also a lean burn combustion engine, except this engine uses a 'draw- -thru' fuel system. The turbocharger 'draws' the air/fuel mixture from the carburetors to the turbocharger, then forces the mixture into the intercooler, intake manifold and finally into the combustion chamber. This system allows operation with a much lower fuel pressure than the GL series.

The VGF F18/H24 GSID is a rich combustion (stoichiometric) engine that uses a 'draw- -thru' fuel system. The turbocharger 'draws' the air/fuel mixture from the carburetors to the turbocharger, then forces the mixture into the intercooler, intake manifold and finally into the combustion chamber. The GSID is typically operated at a setting just rich of stoichiometric (usually when operating with a three way catalyst to produce very low NOx emissions).

## MODEL PLATE (PREVIOUS ENGINES)

The model plate is located on the intake manifold (see Figure 1.15-1). This plate provides information on the engine model, size (bore x stroke), specification number, governed speed, serial number and date of manufacture (see Figure 1.15-1).

Figure 1.15-1. Previous Production Model Plate

<!-- image -->

## SPECIFICATION PLATE (PREVIOUS ENGINES)

Thespecification plate is located onthe breather system baffle box. This plate provides information on the engine compression ratio, timing, firing order, BMEP, duty (either continuous or intermittent) and valve clearance specifications (see Figure 1.15-2).

Whenrequesting information about the engine or parts, it is important to know both the engine model number

and serial number. If the nameplate is defaced or detached, the serial number is stamped on the right rear side surface of the crankcase.

Figure 1.15-2. VGF Specification Plate

<!-- image -->

## SERIAL NUMBERS AND ENGINE NAMEPLATE

Current production engines have the engine model, serial and specification numbers stamped on a single nameplate (see Figure 1.15-3).

spected, special application approval number (power approval), valve clearance, compression ratio, firing order, governed speed, altitude limit at which an engine derate takes place, primary and secondary fuel ratings which show the fuel, minimum Waukesha Knock Index (WKI Ρ ), ignition timing, rated output in horsepower and kilowatts, and overload rating in horsepower and kilowatts (see Figure 1.15-4). This nameplate is located on the forward end of the intake manifold.

Whenrequesting information, you will need to reference both the engine model and serial numbers. If the nameplate is defaced or detached, the serial number may be obtained directly off the crankcase. To locate it, look on the right side of the crankcase, just ahead of the flywheel housing (see Figure 1.15-5).

## ENGINE COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

## CRANKCASE

The crankcase is made of a cast iron alloy with nodular iron main bearing caps. Main bearing caps are secured in place with two main bearing capscrews and two crossbolts per bearing. Upper and lower crankcase doors are provided to allow access to the camshaft, the crankshaft and connecting rods.

The lubrication system is a full pressure system with a gear type pump and three external full flow filter cannisters. An engine mounted cooler reduces the oil temperature.

## CRANKSHAFT

Waukesha F18 and H24 engines rotate in the standard counterclockwise direction when facing the flywheel. The forged steel crankshaft is dynamically balanced and fully counterweighted and supported by seven main bearings in the F18. The H24 uses nine main bearings. A viscous vibration damper mounted on the front of the crankshaft reduces torsional stress.

## CONNECTING RODS

The connecting rods are a drop forged alloy steel with a split serrated mating surface.

## PISTONS

The pistons are made of an aluminum alloy, with a cast- -in resist alloy top ring insert and a full floating piston pin. The pistons have a patented combustion bowlthat allows the use of a lean air/fuel ratio mixture for fuel economy and reduced emissions. The piston and the crown are oil jet cooled and use three rings.

## CYLINDER SLEEVES

The cylinder sleeves are replaceable, wet style, sealed with O- -rings.

## CAMSHAFT

Pivoted roller cam followers are used to transmit camshaft motion to the valves.

## CYLINDER HEAD AND VALVES

This engine uses individual valve- -in- -head cylinder heads. Two Stellite /Ge2 faced intake and two Stellite /Ge2 faced exhaust valves with replaceable valve seats and guides are used in interchangeable cylinder heads.

NOTE: Stellite /Ge2 is a registered trademark of Stoody Deloro Stellite Inc.

## TURBOCHARGER

Ahigh efficiency, radial flow turbocharger is mounted on top of the exhaust manifold on the engine. The turbocharger uses expanding exhaust gases to drive the compressor turbine and generate the required boost levels for the engine.

## INTERCOOLER

A single box type intercooler is mounted at the rear of the engine. The intercooler on GL engines receives air from the turbocharger, cools the charge air and delivers the air to the carburetor. On GLD and GSID engines, the intercooler receives the air/fuel mixture from the carburetor, draws through the turbocharger, then cools the air/fuel charge for delivery to the intake manifold.

## CARBURETOR

The naturally aspirated G model is equipped with a side draft carburetor. The GL model has push through carburetion and the GLD and GSID models have draw through carburetion. Gas regulators are different depending on application and are generally engine mounted.

The standard equipment air cleaner is an engine mounted, two stage, dry element air cleaner with a rain shield and service indicator.

## INTAKE MANIFOLD

The air/fuel mixture passes through the intake manifold located on the left side of the engine. The individual ignition coils for each cylinder are mounted on the intake manifold.

## EXHAUST MANIFOLD

The exhaust manifold is located on the right side of the engine and supplies the exhaust gases to drive the turbochargers. The manifold is jacket water cooled and sound damped with coolant that is supplied by water elbows from each cylinder head.

## INSTRUMENT PANEL GAUGES

Oil Pressure Switchgage: Monitors engine oil pressure at the main oil gallery (see Figure 1.15-17). This switchgage should be adjusted so that the switchgage contacts close when the engine oil pressure falls below asetpoint as specified in Section 6.05 EngineProtection Systems, Table 6.05- -1.

Jacket Water Temperature Switchgage: Monitors engine jacket water temperature at the water outlet header (see Figure 1.15-17). This switchgage should beadjusted so that the switchgage contacts close when the engine jacket water temperature exceeds a setpoint asspecified in Section 6.05 Engine Protection Systems, Table 6.05- -1.

Intake Manifold Temperature Gauge: Monitors intake manifold charge temperature downstream of the intercooler (see Figure 1.15-17). Setpoint depends on application.

Electronic Tachometer: Displays engine crankshaft revolutions per minute (rpm) with a digital readout (see Figure 1.15-17).

Intake Manifold Vacuum/Pressure Gauge: Displays the approximate intake manifold pressure or intake manifold vacuum downstream of the throttle plate (see Figure 1.15-17.)

Lube Oil Temperature Switchgage: Monitors engine oil temperature at the oil filter housing (see Figure 1.15-17). This switchgage should be adjusted so that the switchgage contacts close when the engine oil temperature exceeds a setpoint as specified in Section 6.05 Engine Protection Systems, Table 6.05- -15 .

NOTE: Switchgages are not approved for, or supplied with, hazardous location (CSA approved) ignition equipped engines.

Ammeter: Monitors current output of the belt driven alternator option (see Figure 1.15-17).

Magneto On/Off Switch: Is used as a normal or emergency shutdown switch. This switch will open the magnetoignition circuit (to ground) in the 'OFF' position which blocks the current flow path; and closes the magneto ignition circuit to allow current flow from the magneto to the transformer coils in the 'ON' position (see Figure 1.15-17).

Pushbutton Start Switch: Is used to complete the cranking circuit to the starter solenoid (electric starters) or to engage the starter valve (air/gas starters). See Figure 1.15-17.

## VGF Engine 'G' Lead Test Pigtail Adapters

The early VGF series of engines did not include the 'G' lead in the CEC ignition system. Special pigtail test adapters are available from Waukesha for use with oscilloscope testing. The pigtail adapter is installed between the wiring harness and the CEC Ignition Module. The wire that hangs out is the 'G' lead and can be connected to the oscilloscope.

NOTE: Dry torque values are based on the use of clean, dry threads.

Plated torque values have been reduced by 20% for new plated capscrews.

Oiled torque values have been reduced by 10% when engine oil is used as a lubricant.

Capscrews which are threaded into aluminum may require a torque reduction of 30% or more.

The conversion factor from ft-lb to in-lb is ft-lb x 12 equals in-lb.

NOTE: Engine may contain a copper washer that is installed with the M14 hollow screw. If the piston cooling jet contains a copper washer make sure it is installed during assembly.

## PISTON COOLING JET REMOVAL

The piston cooling jets are located in the crankcase and direct cooling oil to the pistons. The piston cooling jets are installed after the piston and liner to prevent possible damage to the jet. Remove the piston cooling jets to prevent damage during piston and sleeve removal. The jets may be reached by removing the connecting rod inspection doors.

NOTE: Record the cylinder number the cooling jet was positioned at so that it can be reinstalled in its original location.

- 1. RemoveM10x20mmhexheadscrewsandremove connecting rod inspection cover (see Figure 2.05-1).
- 2. Remove M8 socket head screw and M14 hollow screw (see Figure 2.05-2). Remove piston cooling jet.

## ROCKER ARM ASSEMBLY

NOTE: Both the exhaust rocker arm and intake rocker arm use the same assembly procedure.

- 1. Press spring pins into exhaust rocker arm and intake rocker arm. Spring pin end should be free and clear of any obstruction (see Figure 3.00-9).

NOTE: After new bearings are installed they must be bored out to the correct internal diameter (ID). See Table 3.00-2 for specifications.

- 2. Press new bearings into rocker arms. Make sure that the oil holes in bearing and rocker arm align (see Figure 3.00-9).

Figure 3.00-9. Rocker Arm Assembly

<!-- image -->

NOTE: The set screw does not lock the ball socket to the rocker arm. The set screw is used for blocking the end of the rocker arm oil passage.

- 3. Apply Loctite /Ge2 272 to set screw and install in rocker arm.
- 4. Install ball socket and lock nut into rocker arms. Do not fully tighten.

## ROCKER ARM SUPPORT ASSEMBLY

- 1. Press locating pin into bottom of rocker arm support (see Figure 3.00-9).
- 2. Install plug into rocker arm shaft.

<!-- image -->

Always wear safety glasses when removing retaining (snap) rings. Verify the correct retaining ring pliers is used and it is in good condition. If the retaining ring slips off the pliers when being installed or removed, it can be propelled with enough force to cause a serious eye injury. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury.

- 3. Install flat washer and retaining ring onto end of rocker arm shaft.
- NOTE: The two M10 x 35 mm hex head screws, that secure the rocker arm support to the cylinder head, must be inserted into the support before installing the rocker arms.
- 4. Insert two M10 x 35 mm hex head screws into rocker arm support (see Figure 3.00-9). Do not install rocker arm support onto cylinder head at this time.
- 5. Apply clean engine oil to rocker arm shaft and rocker arm.
- 6. Align intake and exhaust rocker arms with rocker arm support (see Figure 3.00-10).
- NOTE: The end of the rocker arm shaft is notched to provide clearance for the M10 x 110 mm hex head screw . While the rocker arm shaft is being installed, gently rotate it to align the 'notch' with the hex head screw hole.
- 7. Push rocker arm shaft through rocker arms and into support. Insert two M10 x 110 mm hex head screws (see Figure 3.00-10).

NOTE: See Section 4.05 Cylinder Head Installation to install the rocker arm support onto the cylinder head. The rocker arm support assembly covers one of the cylinder head nuts and is installed only after the head is secured to the crankcase.

## CYLINDER HEAD INSPECTION

NOTE: Use Magnaflux /Ge4 to inspect the cylinder heads for cracks whenever they are removed from the engine. Contact a local machine shop to have the heads Magnaflux /Ge4 inspected.

- 1. Clean gasket surface and remove any foreign material from cylinder head (see Figure 3.00-12).
- 2. Place straight edge along cylinder head face. Measure gap between straight edge and cylinder head face (see Figure 3.00-13).
- 3. Cylinder head must be resurfaced if gap exceeds 0.003 in. (0.76 mm). Do not remove more than 0.020 in. (0.508 mm) of material.
- 4. Measure distance between cylinder head face and valve face (valve recession) (see Figure 3.00-14).
- 5. Inspect valve face and valve seat for wear. Replace valve, or valve and seat if recession is greater than 0.113 in. (3.00 mm). See 'Valve Condemning' in this chapter.
- 6. Remove water jet from cylinder head face. Install tap in water jet. Tap should cut threads into walls of water jet. Pull tap and water jet from cylinder head.

## EXHAUST/INTAKE VALVE FAILURE ANALYSIS

## VALVE INSPECTION

Inspect the valves for the following conditions:

- /Gb7 Valve stem wear
- /Gb7 Recessed valve face
- /Gb7 Valve face pitting
- /Gb7 Heavy carbon and varnish deposits on the valve stem, rust, or pitting on the valve stem
- /Gb7 Burned valve face
- /Gb7 Worn retainer groove

## VALVES

The major causes of valve failures include:

- /Gb7 Deposits on the valves
- /Gb7 Distortion of the valve seat
- /Gb7 Improper valve clearance
- /Gb7 Scuffing of the valve stem
- /Gb7 Deposits on the valve guide
- /Gb7 Erosion
- /Gb7 Heat fatigue
- /Gb7 Breaks
- /Gb7 Wear

Deposits on the valves can be a result of too high a valve stem temperature for the type of oil that is being used or the use of high ash oil. See Lube Oil Recommendations- -Service Bulletin 12- -1880Y (or latest revision) .

These deposits can reduce the effectiveness of the heat transfer to the cylinder head and result in valve failure. Additional factors which can cause deposit related valve failures include:

- /Gb7 Valve seats that have been ground too wide will reduce the seating pressure and reduce the valves' ability to crush deposits when closing.

Distortion of the valve seat can lead to burned valves and is usually caused by:

- /Gb7 Failure of the cooling system.
- /Gb7 Loose valve seats which reduce or stop the transfer of heat between the valve seat insert and the cylinder head.
- /Gb7 Warped sealing surfaces on the head or crankcase which can distort the valve seats when the head is torqued. Improper tightening, excess fastener torque, and using the wrong torque sequence can also distort the valve seats.

Improper valve clearance can cause the valve to be held off its seat and the resulting blow- -by will burn the valve face. Causes of improper valve clearance include:

- /Gb7 Valve clearance not set to the proper specification.
- /Gb7 Valve clearance not reset after engine break- -in and cylinder head retorque.

Scuffing of the valve stem can be the result of a lack of lubrication, too much or too little stem to guide clearance, or as a damaged finished surface on the valve stem of valve guide.

Deposits on the guide can cause lacquering of the stem or guide and cause the valve to be held open.

Erosion of the valve stem under the valve head can result in valve breakage. Causes of valve erosion include:

- /Gb7 High H2S levels
- /Gb7 Faulty combustion
- /Gb7 Excessive valve temperatures
- /Gb7 Improper air/fuel mixture ratios which overheat and erode the valves (rich burn engines) due to slow burn rate.

Heat fatigue (overheating) can cause valve head cracking and breakage. Causes of heat fatigue include:

- /Gb7 Worn valve guides
- /Gb7 Distorted valve seats
- /Gb7 Improper air/fuel ratios

Breaks are generally two different types:

- /Gb7 Fatigue breaks are the gradual breakdown of the valve due to high heat and pressure.
- /Gb7 Impact breaks are the mechanical breakage of the valve caused by seating the valve with too much force.

Wear on the valve stem and guide can cause valve face burning. Worn valve guides lead to valve failures:

- /Gb7 Wornvalve guides lead to out of round seating, which allows leakage and the resulting valve face burning.
- /Gb7 Excessive valve stem to guide clearance allows too much oil to run down the stem, which causes excessive deposits and results in the valve sticking.

Causes of worn valve guides include:

- /Gb7 Worn rocker arms which cause excessive side thrust on the valve stem.
- /Gb7 Poor lubrication which results in scoring.
- /Gb7 Carbondeposits on the valve stem will wear the valve guide into a bell- -mouthed shape.

## VALVE REPAIR

## VALVE CLEANING

<!-- image -->

Alwayswearfacemaskprotectionwhenoperatinga powerdriven wire brush. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

Remove the valves from the cylinder head. Clean the valves with a power driven wire brush, being careful not to scratch the valve stem.

## VALVE CONDEMNING

- 1. Replace both valve and seat if valve recession exceeds 0.118 in. (3.00 mm).

NOTE: See Table 3.00-7 and Table 3.00-8 for complete valve and cylinder head dimensions.

- 2. If valve recession is acceptable, but valve requires replacement or reconditioning, valve seats must be reground. Grind valve seats to a 20 /Gb0 angle.

NOTE: The valve face or stem may be ground in an attempt to resurface or remanufacture a worn valve. If the resurfaced valve exceeds the specifications listed, then it must be replaced (Figure 3.00-22 and Table 3.00-7).

## VALVE STEM RESURFACING

- 1. Measurevalve at three different locations along stem (see Table 3.00-7). If stem diameter is less than 0.429 in. (10.896 mm), replace valve.
- 2. Check valve stem runout with a dial indicator after resurfacing. Replace valve if stem runout is greater than 0.002 in. (0.050 mm).

## VALVE RESURFACING

NOTE: Replace both valve and seat if valve recession exceeds 0.118 in. (3.00 mm).

- 1. Use the diamond tool to dress the grinding wheel.
- 2. Grind valves to correct 20 /Gb0 angle, width and contact pattern.
- 3. Take only light cuts from valve face surface.
- NOTE: Always move the stone away from the valve when finished. Moving the valve away from the stone while in contact will leave a groove in the surface of the valve.
- 4. Continue to make light cuts until all surface imperfections are removed and runout is within specifications.
- 5. Valves must be replaced if more than 0.020 in. (0.5 mm) of material is removed from valve face angle during resurfacing. The minimum thickness for both intake and exhaust valves is 0.075 in. (1.90 mm) (see Figure 3.00-22).
- 6. Check valve face runout after resurfacing. Valve must be replaced if runout is greater than 0.002 in. (0.050 mm).

## VALVE GUIDE INSTALLATION

NOTE: The valve guides must be installed before installing the valve seats. The valve seat installation tool uses the valve guide to center itself.

Select the correct valve guide for your engine application (see applicable VGF Parts Catalog). Install valve guides from top of cylinder head. Use valve guide installation tool P/N 472009.

- 1. Apply a small amount of grease onto valve guide.
- 2. Press valve guide into cylinder head. Valve guide tool will 'bottom out' at spring seat area (see Figure 3.00-23). Valve guide length is equal for all four valves.

## CYLINDER HEAD DISASSEMBLY AND OVERHAUL

## VALVE SEAT INSTALLATION

NOTE: Read the complete instructions on installing valve seats before attempting the procedure.

NOTE: The valve guides must be installed before installing the valve seats. The valve seat installation tool uses the valve guide to center itself.

- 1. Clean cylinder head valve seat bore.

NOTE: High temperature head gasket (P/N 300000D) is thinner than previous gaskets. Because of this, the valve seat insert must also be thinner in order to provide the proper valve- -to- -piston clearance. If high temperature head gasket (P/N 300000D) is used, then valve seat insert (P/N 304010L) must be installed or grind down valve seat insert (P/N 304010K). All VGF engines built in the United States after August 15, 1997 use the P/N 300000D gasket.

NOTE: If using cylinder head gasket P/N 300000B, either valve seat insert (P/N 304010K or P/N 304010L) is acceptable without modification.

- 2. Install valve seat. If using high temperature head gasket (P/N 300000D) and valve seat (P/N 304010K), be prepared to grind valve seat to obtain proper valve recession.

NOTE: The valve seats must be chilled in either liquid nitrogen or a solution of dry ice and denatured alcohol. The outside diameter of the valve seats will shrink when they are chilled. This chilling process allows the valve seat to fit into the cylinder valve bore. As the valve seat warms to room temperature, it expands and produces an extremely tight fit with its mated cylinder bore.

<!-- image -->

Complywiththeliquid nitrogen/Dry Ice manufacturer's recommendations for proper use and handling of liquid nitrogen/Dry Ice. Improper handling or use of liquid nitrogen/Dry Ice will result in severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Liquid nitrogen - -196 /Gb0 F (- -126 /Gb0 C) and dry ice - -78 /Gb0 F (- -61 /Gb0 C) are extremely cold and will cause severe burns if they come into contact with human skin. To prevent burns to the skin, wear protective equipment when working with liquid nitrogen or dry ice. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

To cool valve seats with liquid nitrogen:

- /Gb7 Attach a thin wire with a hook on one end to each of the four valve seats. The wire must be long enough to extend out of the container and allow easy removal without placing your hand into the container. Lower the valve seats into a container of liquid nitrogen. Make sure that there is enough liquid nitrogen in the container to completely cover all the valve seats.

To cool valve seats with Dry Ice and denatured alcohol:

- /Gb7 Attach a thin wire with a hook on one end to each of the four valve seats and place them in a container of dry ice covered with denatured alcohol. The wire must be long enough to extend out of the container and allow easy removal without placing your hand into the container. The wire is used to remove the valve seats from the dry ice.

NOTE: The amount of time needed to chill the valve seats depends on the freezing agent that is used. If liquid nitrogen is used, the valve seat will be sufficiently chilled after the liquid nitrogen stops boiling, usually about 5 minutes. If a solution of dry ice and denatured alcohol is used, the valve seat will be sufficiently chilled if it remains in the solution for at least 20 minutes.

- 3. Use 'hooked' wire to remove valve seat from chilling agent.
- 4. Quickly remove valve seat ( do not use bare hands) from wire and place it onto valve seat installation tool P/N 472004.
- 5. Quickly insert installation tool and seat into cylinder head valve bore. Drive valve seat into bore until it has bottomed (see Figure 3.00-24).

Figure 3.00-24. Valve Seat Installation Tool - P/N 472004

<!-- image -->

- 6. Install remaining valve seats.
- 7. Measure and record valve recession. Insert valve into cylinder head. Measure distance from cylinder head face to valve face (see Figure 3.00-25 and Figure 3.00-26).
- 8. If using high temperature cylinder head gasket (P/N 300000D), a valve recession of 0.059 - - 0.079 in. (1.5 - 2.0 mm) is required (see Figure 3.00-26).
- 9. If using cylinder head gasket (P/N 300000B), valve recession must not exceed 0.118 in. (3.00 mm).
- 10. Grind valve seats as required.

## VALVE SEAT GRINDING

NOTE: See Figure 3.00-28 and Table 3.00-10 for complete valve seat specifications.

NOTE: Use of the Hall- -Toledo EDP Valve Seat Grinder (P/N 494277) is the only factory approved service method of grinding valve seats (an eccentric grinder, diamond dresser, stand and necessary wrenches are included).

<!-- image -->

Machining accuracy depends upon the fit of the pilot mandrel. The pilot mandrel should fit snugly in the guide and in the hub of the grinder stone. Be sure that the upper end of the mandrel does not wobble during the grinding procedure. Upper end movement will produce a seat that is not ground true, causing damage to equipment.

NOTE: The pilot mandrel allows each valve seat to be ground concentric with the valve guide. The pilot mandrels (P/N 472035) supplied by Waukesha Engine are made only for use with the Hall- -Toledo EDP Valve Seat Grinder.

- 1. Install handle on pilot mandrel. Insert mandrel (0.564 in.) into intake or exhaust valve guide. Turn round knob until mandrel is snug (see Figure 3.00-27).
- 2. Remove handle from pilot mandrel. Slide on dial indicator that reads 0.001 in. (0.0254 mm) (P/N 494278) (see Figure 3.00-27).
- 3. Measure valve seat concentricity to determine amount of valve seat grinding required.

- Always dress the stone before grinding. The stone should be dressed to the proper angle after
- 4. Refer to Table 3.00-9 to select proper degree angle grinding stone. Rough grind valve seat insert until a total indicated runout of not more than 0.002 in. (0.0508 mm) or /Gb1 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) is obtained.

Table 3.00-9. Valve Seat Insert Grinding Stones

| TYPE STONE   | ANGLE      |   TOOL P/N |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Seat Angle   | 20 Degrees |     494014 |

NOTE: Install a fine grit stone or dress the stone with fine compound to perform the final grinding.

- 5. Finish grind valve seat until it becomes highly polished and has a total indicated runout of less than 0.001 in. (0.025 mm).
- 6. Repeat grinding procedure as necessary.

Compressed air can pierce the skin and cause severe personal injury or death. Never use your hand to check for leaks or to determine air flow rates. Wear safety glasses to shield your eyes from flying dirt and debris.

<!-- image -->

Always use approved cleaning solvents in a well ventilated area. Contact with skin could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 7. Use compressed air to blow away all loose dust. Wipe down valve seat and seat insert surfaces with a non- -volatile cleaning solution or solvent and dry with a clean cloth.

NOTE: Valve seat selection depends on the cylinder head gasket installed on crankcase.

## VALVE SEAT LAPPING

- 1. Apply a fine grinding compound sparingly around entire valve edge (face) (see Figure 3.00-22).

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Lap the valves in the location in which they will be installed.

- 2. Install a light lifting spring over valve stem.
- 3. Apply lubricating oil into valve guide bore and slide valve into cylinder head. Spring should hold valve off seat.
- 4. Press down until valve is seated. Rotate valve a 1/4 turn, first in one direction, then in the other. Do this three or four times.
- 5. Release pressure on valve stem, spring should lift valve straight off its seat. Turn valve about 10 to 15 degrees clockwise and repeat grinding procedure. Continue until valve has been rotated a complete 360 degrees and all grinding compound has been rubbed off valve seat.
- 6. Remove valve and spring from cylinder head. Clean valve and valve seat insert of any lapping compound.

removed from the valve and valve seat. Failure to completely clean all lapping compound from the valve and valve seat could cause damage to equipment.

Ensure that all lapping compound is completely

- 7. Carefully inspect mating surfaces. A properly lapped valve will show a gray, frosty surface. If properly lapped, lapped surface width will equal valve seat width (see Table 3.00-10).
- 8. Repeat lapping procedure if necessary. Regrind valve seat insert if results are not acceptable.
- 9. Apply Permatex /Ge2 Prussian blue dye sparingly around entire circumference of valve seat surface.
- NOTE: The blue dye will be removed where the valve and seat make contact (contact pattern).
- NOTE: If the valve contact pattern is not correctly centered on the valve face or does not show around the entire valve seat, grind the seat , not the valve.
- 10. Install valve in cylinder head. Gently push down on valve stem until valve face just contacts valve seat. Do not rotate or turn valve. Carefully pull valve straight out of head.

## VALVE SPRINGS

## CYLINDER HEAD ASSEMBLY

NOTE: Always test or replace valve springs during cylinder head overhauls.

- 1. Clean valve springs, seats and retainers with a suitable solvent.
- 2. Examine valve springs, seats, and retainers for rust pitting and cracks. Replace pitted or cracked springs.
- 3. Measure spring free length. Measure load at specified length (use spring scale). Replace springs that do not meet specifications.

## VALVE SPLIT LOCKS (KEEPERS)

NOTE: Always use new split locks with new valves.

- 1. Clean valve split locks with a suitable solvent.
- 2. Inspect inside and outside for wear. Excessive wear can allow the valve spring retainer to slide off.

NOTE: Wear on the outside of the split locks can be caused by overspeeding the engine or the engine being assembled out of time.

## SET SCREW REPLACEMENT

P/N 300302A and earlier cylinder heads are equipped with set screw plugs at two locations in the sides of the heads. These plugs block oil passages drilled in the cylinder head during manufacturing.

- 1. Install set screws (if removed). Apply Perma- -Lok /Ge2 LH050 or LH150.

## CUP PLUG INSTALLATION

- 1. Install cup plugs (if removed). Apply Permatex /Ge2 Form- -a- -Gasket /Ge2 HD3 to cup plugs.

## EXPANDER PLUG REPLACEMENT

NOTE: P/N 300302B cylinder heads are equipped with expander plugs in two locations. These plugs block oil passages drilled in the cylinder head during manufacturing. The expander plug is made of a sleeve and a ball. The ball is driven into the sleeve, causing the sleeve to expand and grip the wall of the drilled hole (see Figure 3.00-29).

- 1. Drill expander plug out with a carbide tipped drill. Sleeve must be completely removed. Use a 'pick' to remove any remaining pieces.

Figure 3.00-29. Expander Plug Location

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Expander plugs are available in two sizes; one for use in the standard size hole and a 1 mm oversized plug for use in service situations. Production expander plug (P/N 306024) uses a 7 mm hole. Service expander plug (P/N 306024A) uses a 8 mm hole.

- 2. Drill out expander hole using a 8 mm drill. Do not drill deeper than original expander hole.

NOTE: If needed, polish out all marks in expander hole. Surface must be smooth in order for sleeve to seal properly.

- 3. Place service expander plug (P/N 306024A) into hole.
- 4. Drive expander ball into sleeve. Top edge of sleeve must be below cylinder head surface. Expander plug must be driven below top of sleeve.

## VALVE INSTALLATION (ALL CURRENT ENGINES EXCEPT F18/H24G'S)

NOTE: Always reinstall the valve components in their original locations.

Cylinder head assembly P/N AE300302C is required for VGF F18/H24GL Low Compression Ratio (LCR) and High Compression Ratios (HCR) engines.

P/N AE300302C includes valve spring retainer, P/N 304014A. Valve spring retainer (P/N 304014A) has a groove and 4 holes in the top surface to allow more oil to reach the valve stem (see Figure 3.00-35).

Oil on the valve stem is controlled by new 'barbed' seals. Different seals are used on the intake and exhaust valves. The valve seals are color coded for easy identification:

P/N 304015C, Blue, Intake Valve Stem Seal P/N 304015B, Black, Exhaust Valve Stem Seal

<!-- image -->

Failure to use Tool P/N 472077 will result in damage to the valve seals (P/N 304015C or P/N 304015B) making them ineffective. Improper installation of these valve seals could result in severe engine damage.

A new valve guide, P/N 300009C, is required when using the new valve stem seals. This guide features a barbed end to hold the seal in place.

Valve P/N 300036K is used for both intake and exhaust valve locations. This valve has a polished chrome stem to reduce valve stem seal wear.

## CRANKCASE CLEANING AND INSPECTION

NOTE: The crankshaft should already be removed from the crankcase. Refer to Chapter 2.05 Crankcase Component Removal 'Crankshaft Removal' for additional information.

## CRANKCASE DESCRIPTION

The crankcase is made of cast iron. Crankshaft main bearing saddles are machined in the crankcase 'webs.' Oil passages are drilled in the crankcase and route lube oil to the main bearings. Excess lube oil collects in the oil pan and is then pumped back through the crankcase.

Each main bearing cap is secured to the crankcase with two vertical bolts and two horizontal crossbolts. The two horizontal crossbolts, one from each side, provide exact positioning between the crankcase and each bearing cap. This provides the necessary support for the lower part of the crankcase.

Routine access to the crankcase is through inspection openings located on the left hand side of the engine block. A single camshaft is located on the left hand side of the crankcase. The bottom of the crankcase is enclosed by the oil pan.

<!-- image -->

Be sure you have read and understood the safety and warning information in Section 1.05 Safety and Section 1.10 Rigging And Lifting Engines , before proceeding. Failure to take adequate precautions when servicing this product can result in severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Never walk or stand under an engine or component while it is suspended. Use properly rated lifting equipment and approved lifting methods. Failure to take adequate precautions can result in severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

The six cylinder crankcase weighs 1384 lb. (628 kg) and the eight cylinder crankcase weighs 1845 lb. (837 kg) completely stripped of other components. If ANY components are still attached, the crankcase will be heavier by the amount of the component's weight. Make sure that the crankcase is properly supported and that properly rated lifting equipment and rigging are used. Failure to take adequate precautions can result in severe personal injury or death.

## CRANKCASE CLEANING

Crankcases should be cleaned by 'hot tanking,' however, alternative methods may be used. Lime and scale deposits must be removed. A caustic solution such as Oaklite 32 will break down lime deposits into solution. Steam cleaning will only break down oil deposits and not lime deposits.

Precision machined surfaces must be clean in order to get accurate measurements. All cylinder liner bores must be cleaned down to bare metal for proper cylinder liner sealing.

## CRANKCASE INSPECTION

The crankcase should be thoroughly checked for cracks. Special attention should be paid to the area between the cylinders. Cracks may be detected by using a dye penetrant. The lower cylinder liner seal area in the cylinder block must be checked. Crankcase tolerances are listed in Table 3.05-11. Discard the crankcase if any cracks are found.

## CRANKSHAFT CLEANING, INSPECTION AND REPAIR

## CRANKSHAFT CLEANING

<!-- image -->

Never remove the crankshaft counterweights from the crankshaft. The crankshaft is balanced at the factory with the counterweights attached. The counterweight mounting holes are oversize, and it is impossible to attach the weights back in the original positions. Disregarding this information will result in product damage and/or personal injury.

Once the crankshaft is removed from the engine it should be thoroughly cleaned. All VGF crankshafts have internal oil passages.

These openings are plugged with set screws to prevent loss of engine oil pressure. Prior to hot tank cleaning, these set screws should be removed from the crankshaft.

Always remove the set screws from the crankshaft for proper cleaning of the oil passages. If the set screws are not removed, they will make flushing of the oil passages difficult and will prevent inspection of the oil passages for debris.

Cleaning solution can easily be trapped in these passages and bearing failure can result upon engine startup. Insert a high pressure air line into the passageways and blow out any remaining cleaning solution. Verify all cleaning solution is thoroughly removed from the oil passageways.

- 1. Remove set screws from crankshaft (see Figure 3.05-1).
- 2. Flush cleaning solution through oil passages. Run a wire brush through all oil passages to loosen deposits.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Compressed air can pierce the skin and cause severe injury. Never use your hand to check for leaks or to determine air flow rates. Wear safety glasses to shield your eyes from flying dirt and debris. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 3. Dry crankshaft with compressed air after it is removed from hot tank. Insert a stiff, clean wire through all oil passages to verify they are clear of any obstructions.
- 4. Coat crankshaft with a thin coat of oil to prevent surface oxidation.

Make sure set screws are installed in the oil passages of the crankshaft. An engine operating without crankshaft set screws installed will have bearing failure and piston/sleeve damage due to low oil pressure. Disregarding this information will result in product damage and/or personal injury.

- 5. Apply Loctite /Ge2/G20 242 to set screw threads. Tighten set screws until three threads show below crankshaft surface (see Figure 3.05-1). Peen set screws into place (see note below).

NOTE: Wedge a pointed punch between the set screw and crankshaft threads. Strike the punch to bend the crankshaft threads and lock the set screw in place. Remove any metal chips. Repeat for remaining set screws.

- 6. Carefully examine entire crankshaft and verify all oil passages have set screws installed.

## CRANKSHAFT INSPECTION AND MEASUREMENT

## CRANKSHAFT REPAIR

The crankshaft should be checked with Magnaflux /Ge2 for cracks. Small surface cracks (a few thousandths of an inch deep) in the journals can be ground out. The crankshaft must be checked with Magnaflux /Ge2 again to verify the removal of all surface cracks. Never use a crankshaft that has known cracks in it.

Crankshafts which require grinding (turning) should be sent to a machine shop or crankshaft repair facility.

- 1. Inspect and check with Magnaflux /Ge2 main bearing journals, connecting rod journals and bearing fillets (see Figure 3.05-2). These areas are most likely to develop cracks.
- 2. Measure and record main bearing journal outside diameter (OD) and connecting rod journal OD. Compare recorded measurements to specifications listed in Table 3.05-13. Measurements are used in crankshaft grinding.
- 3. Measureandinspect end play thrust surface. If it is in poor condition, the surface must be reground. Compare recorded measurements to specifications listed in Table 3.05-13.
- 4. Inspect the thrust washer thrust surface. If the thrust surface is in poor condition, the washer must be replaced. Compare recorded measurements to specifications listed in Table 3.05-13.

NOTE: The crankshaft may have some deflection under its own weight when supported between centers. Deflection usually follows a symmetrical pattern.

- 5. Inspect the crankshaft for straightness. The shaft must be inspected for straightness before it can be ground.

NOTE: Repairs to the crankshaft journals should only be performed by a firm specializing in such work. Contact your distributor or Waukesha Engine's Service Operations Department for the latest information regarding this process.

## Crankshaft Polishing

If the crankshaft journal surface is uneven, but the specifications are still within limits, the journal should be polished. Do not polish the journal by 'hand.' Polishing the crankshaft, where critical tolerances are involved, requires great skill and specialized equipment. Waukesha Engine recommends contacting a company which specializes in polishing such highly machined surfaces.

chromed crankshaft, or verification of a possible crack under the chrome plate, the chrome plating must be ground off and the shaft inspected. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

If there is any doubt as to the condition of a

NOTE: Thecrankshaft journals must be stress relieved (shot- -peened) prior to grinding.

There are two options when machining the crankshaft:

- /Gb7 Option 1 - If standard size bearings are to be used:
- 1. Chrome plate crankshaft journals. Do not chrome plate fillet surfaces. Crankshaft chrome plating should have a hardness of 50 Rockwell 'C.'

- 2. Grind crankshaft journals to new maximum OD as specified in Table 3.05-13. There should be approximately 0.060 in. (1.524 mm) of chrome plate remaining. Crankshaft main and rod journals should be finished to a '12 RMS' finish.
- /Gb7 Option 2 - If undersized bearings (0.020 in.) are used:
- 1. Grind crankshaft journals so they are 0.020 in. (0.51 mm) less than new maximum OD (see Table 3.05-13).
- 2. Install appropriate undersized bearings. Crankshaft main and rod journals should be finished to a '12 RMS' finish.

After a crankshaft is re- built and before it is installed into the engine, check and verify that all tolerances are correct. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

## Crankshaft Grinding

Whencrankshafts are balanced, they must be balanced with counterweights attached. If required, always remove metal from the counterweights.

Precision balancing of crankshafts can increase bearing life 25 to 100 percent.

Static balancing (shaft is placed on knife edges and will come to rest with the heaviest part of the shaft on the bottom) is not adequate.

Maximum allowable unbalance in static and dynamic mode is 4.3 ounce inches (312 grams centimeter).

The shaft must be spin balanced. Spin balancers are able to locate kinetic and dynamic unbalance. This type of unbalance creates forces that cause the shaft to rock and twist on an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Rotating the crankshaft is the only method capable of identifying this type of balance problem.

Crankshaft Counterweights

<!-- image -->

Tighten counterweight hex head screws to the proper torque. Improperly tightened hex head screws can cause the counterweights to become loose, resulting in catastrophic engine damage and possible severe personal injury or death.

To prevent loose counterweights, verify counterweight hex head screws are tightened to 210 ft-lb /G20/Gb1 5 (285 N m /Gd7 /G20/Gb1 7). Check counterweight hex head screw torque whenever the following conditions exist:

- /Gb7 Crankshaft has been removed from engine
- /Gb7 30 to 60 days after initial startup (rebuilt or new)
- /Gb7 Once a year
- 1. Retighten each counterweight capscrew to 210 ft-lb /G20/Gb1/G20 5 (285 N m /Gd7 /G20/Gb1/G20 7).
- 2. Any hex head screw not meeting torque specifications must be inspected (includes washer).
- 3. Check hex head screw for nicks, cracks, galled or stretched threads and/or other damage. Check washer for nicks and abrasive wear. Replace counterweight hex head screw (P/N 304051) and/or hardened washer (P/N 304052B) if any defects are found.

Crankshaft Counterweight Installation

weights from the crankshaft. The crankshaft is balanced at the factory with the counterweights attached. The counterweight mounting holes are oversized, and it is impossible to attach the weights back in their original positions. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

Never remove the crankshaft counter-

- If counterweights are removed, use the following procedure:
- 1. Place counterweight on crankshaft flat with part number facing main bearing journal.
- 2. Verify locating dowel pins are in position for each counterweight.

Figure 3.05-3. Crankshaft

<!-- image -->

- 3. Verify counterweight and crankshaft cheek are stamped with identical location numbers (see Figure 3.05-3).

<!-- image -->

Installing the counterweights in the wrong location will cause the crankshaft to be unbalanced. Operating an engine with an unbalanced crankshaft could result in catastrophic engine damage and possible severe personal injury or death.

- 4. Verify counterweight side is flush with or slightly set back from crankshaft wall on main bearing side. Counterweight may overlap wall slightly on rod bearing side.

NOTE: Overlapping the wall on the main bearing side will interfere with installation of the main bearing cap.

- 5. Lubricate the first few threads of counterweight bolt, underside of bolt head and one side of hardened washer with engine oil.
- 6. Slide hardened washer on bolt with lubricated side facing bolt head.
- 7. Secure counterweight to crankshaft with bolts. Tighten bolts to 210 ft-lb /G20/Gb1 5 (285 N m /Gd7 /G20/Gb1 7).

## CAMSHAFT

CAMSHAFT CLEANING AND INSPECTION

<!-- image -->

Replace all camshaft follower assemblies when a new camshaft is installed. Wear patterns onusedfollowerscould result in early failure of a new camshaft.

NOTE: If any of the camshaft drive gears exceed the gear lash tolerances, they MUST be replaced.

NOTE: The camshaft bearings should be replaced at engine overhaul.

Normally the camshaft needs no special maintenance, other than regular inspections of its bearings, journals, and cam lobes when other routine maintenance is performed (see Table 3.05-2).

Since camshafts rotate at 1/2 engine speed and are liberally lubricated, camshaft bearing surfaces are usually found in good condition. If after inspection, the camshaft or its journals are not in satisfactory condition, it will be necessary to chrome plate the camshaft and grind it back to size.

<!-- image -->

Keep all chrome from fillet areas. Camshaft journals should be polished after the camshaft is ground back to standard size. Disregarding this information could result in product damage.

NOTE: Camshaft coupling must never be loose (8 cylinder engines).

- 2. Polish camshaft lobes using a lathe.
- 3. Inspect camshaft for heavily pitted areas. Replace camshafts that have pitting that cannot be polished out.
- 4. Inspect camshaft followers.
- 5. Check camshaft for straightness. Support end bearing journals of camshaft on blocks. Rotate camshaft and check for straightness with a dial indicator. Camshaft must be straight within 0.001 in. (0.0254 mm).
- 6. Check camshaft bearing journal running clearance (this check should be repeated after polishing, before assembly).

NOTE: Oil flows through the camshaft bushings and into the camshaft. The camshaft itself directs oil flow to lubricate the cam followers and to drilled passages to the cylinder heads. Remove the plugs from both ends of the camshaft and thoroughly clean the internal passage of sludge.

- 7. Flush cleaning solution through oil passages. Loosen deposits in oil passages with a stiff wire brush.

Replacement (new) camshaft followers are shipped from the factory coated with a light rust preventative. Never immerse new camshaft followers in any type of cleaning solvent. This would not onlyremovetheouterrustpreventative coating,but would also remove the lubricant from the camshaft follower bushing and pin, which could result in failure of the component.

- 1. Clean camshaft followers of any varnish or buildup.
- 2. Inspect cam follower roller for smooth rotation (ensure that roller is properly lubricated). Check roller for tight or loose spots.
- 3. Inspect outside diameter (OD) of roller for scuffing or chips (see Figure 3.05-5).
- 4. Disassemble cam follower and measure components for wear (see Table 3.05-3, Figure 3.05-5 and Figure 3.05-6). Replace worn components.

NOTE: Never install 'used' retaining rings. If the retaining rings are removed from the camshaft followers, replace them with new ones.

Never operate an engine with a cracked piston. Operating an engine with a cracked piston could result in severe engine damage and possible severe personal injury or death.

NOTE: One of the most important areas to dye check pistons for cracks is around the top of piston pin bore.

- 7. Use Magnaflux /Ge2 Dye Penetrant Test Kit (P/N 494283) to test piston for surface cracks. Test around pin bores, ring lands and oil drain holes.
- 8. Polish pistons and pin bores with fine grit crocus cloth to remove minor scuff marks and scratches.
- 9. Replace cracked and/or damaged pistons. If piston shows no cracks or excessive damage, continue inspection.

Waukesha assumes absolutely no liability for any damage that may occur from engine parts that exceed the published wear limit. Reuse of engine parts that do not meet the new part specifications are the sole responsibility of the user. Under no circumstances is the reuse of any part exceeding the published wear limits justified.

Although Waukesha recognizes that many used parts are suitable for continued service, there is almost always a corresponding reduction in performance. Carefully consider the following items before reusing any particular part: (a.) The number of mating parts being reused. (b.) The extent of the repair relative to the expected service life prior to the next major overhaul. (c.) The engine application, such as horsepower requirement, maintenance intervals and type of installation. (d.) The problems that may occur through reuse.

- 10. Measure piston diameter 'A' 90 degrees from piston pin bore (see A in Table 3.05-4). Discard piston if diameter exceeds limits.
- 11. Measure inside diameter (ID) of piston pin bore at four locations (see B in Table 3.05-4). Discard piston if ID exceeds limits.

NOTE: Worn ring grooves result in high oil consumption and blow- -by of exhaust gases. Blow- -by of exhaust gasescontaminates the engine oil with acids and leaves sludge in the crankcase.

- 12. Insert edge of new ring into piston ring groove (see Figure 3.05-10).

- 13. Insert feeler gauge between ring upper surface and ring land. Measure and record ring groove side clearance.
- 14. Measure and record ring groove side clearance at several locations around piston circumference.
- 15. Replace pistons that exceed limits (see Table 3.05-5).
- 16. Cover pistons with clean plastic sheet to protect from dust and dirt.

ning time) piston rings. Previously used rings will not seat or wear properly. Installing used rings will result in decreased oil control and compression.

Do not install used (more than 50 hours run-

- 1. Insert new ring into cylinder sleeve. Install piston upside down into cylinder liner. Push ring with piston to lower end of cylinder bore. Measure ring gap with feeler gauge. Discard piston ring if gap exceeds limits listed in Table 3.05-5.

<!-- image -->

Insufficient ring gap may cause the ends to abut at engine operating temperatures, resulting in ring breakage, sleeve scuffing and/or piston seizure. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

<!-- image -->

Excessive ring gap results in high oil consumption and blow- -by of exhaust gases. Blow- -by of exhaust gases contaminates the engine oil supply with acids and leaves sludge in the crankcase. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

## PISTON PIN CLEANING AND INSPECTION

- 1. Wash piston pins in a non- -caustic cleaning solution or solvent.

<!-- image -->

Compressed air can pierce the skin and cause severe injury. Never use your hand to check for leaks or to determine air flow rates. Wear safety glasses to shield your eyes from flying dirt and debris. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 2. Dry piston pins with compressed air.

NOTE: Always replace the pin when a new piston is installed.

- 3. Visually inspect pin for etching, scoring, damage or excessive wear. Any surface wear or defect that may be felt is cause for replacement.
- 4. Measure outside diameter (OD) of piston pin where pin bore and rod bushings make contact. See

Table 3.05-6 and Figure 3.05-11 for piston pin specifications. Discard pin if it exceeds limits.

Figure 3.05-11. Piston Pin

Lack of attention to the integrity of the connect-

- 1. Clean connecting rod mating surfaces between rod and cap with non- -caustic solution.
- NOTE: Current connecting rod bolts (P/N 304055B) should be replaced during major overhaul or if excessive overspeed, over tightening, or hydraulic lock are suspected. Previous connecting rod bolts may only be retightened three times before replacement.
- 2. Clean oil hole located at top of rod. Clean all bolts thoroughly. Replace bolts if damaged.

NOTE: Do not re- -tap the connecting rods or chase the bolt threads. The connecting rod and bolts are tapped with a 'rolled' thread and cannot be duplicated.

- 3. Inspect all connecting rod bolts for nicks or damage. When lubricated with SAE 30 weight oil, bolts must screw into rod face by hand. If bolt will not screw in by hand, clean thread and try a new bolt. If a new bolt does not screw in freely, the rod must be discarded.

- 4. Install connecting rod cap and secure with connecting rod bolts and washers (see Figure 3.05-12.). Lubricate bolt threads and washer faces with clean engine oil and tighten to 310 /G20/Gb1 15 ft-lb (420 /G20/Gb1 20 N m). /Gd7
- 5. Measure and record the three inside diameters at points 'A,' 'B,' and 'C' as shown in Figure 3.05-12.
- /Gb7 If the difference between points 'A' and 'C' exceeds 0.002 in. (0.05 mm), rod is unusable (use Table 3.05-7 for calculations).

- 2. Use tool P/N 472012 to install piston pin bushings (see Figure 3.05-17).
- 3. Bore pin bushing to correct size (see note below).

Figure 3.05-16. Connecting Rod Small End

<!-- image -->

NOTE: The piston pin bushing inside diameter is unfinished and must be sized to match the piston pin being used with each connecting rod. When installing the bushing, the oil hole must be in alignment with the connecting rod oil hole (see Figure 3.05-16).

NOTE: The pin bushing center must be located 12.204 - - 12.205 in. (309.9 - - 310.0 mm) from the center of the crankshaft bore (large end of rod), after machining. It is acceptable for the pin bushing wear surface (thickness) to be unequal between top and bottom. The center to center rod length must be maintained (see Table 3.05-9).

- 4. Turn the connecting rod upside down and clamp in a vise.
- 5. Install new bearing inserts. Do not touch bearing surfaces.

<!-- image -->

Connecting rod bolts can be tightened and loosened three times before they must be replaced. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

- 6. Install connecting rod cap and secure with connecting rod bolts and washers (see Figure 3.05-12). Lubricate bolt threads and washer faces with clean engine oil and tighten to 66 ft-lb (90 N m). /Gd7
- 7. Measure and record connecting rod bearing bore ID. Compare recorded measurements with specifications listed in Table 3.05-9.
- 8. If measurement exceeds limitations, connecting rod must be resized or replaced.
- 9. To determine connecting rod bearing running clearance, subtract connecting rod bore ID (bearing installed) from crankshaft connecting rod journal OD.

NOTE: Bearing running clearance is 0.003 in. (0.076 mm) minimum to 0.007 in. (0.178 mm) maximum.

## CYLINDER LINER INSPECTION

## CYLINDER LINER DEGLAZING

NOTE: Deglazing removes wear patterns, minor scuff marks and scratches without enlarging the liner bore diameter. Use a flexible ball- -type deglazing tool (see Figure 3.05-18), (8-1/2 in. bore - -P/N 494236; 9-3/8 in. bore - - P/N 494234). The bristle tip or finishing stone arrangement (180 to 250 grit) is able to produce a 60 degree cross hatch pattern (see Figure 3.05-19). Theangular cross hatch pattern ensures an even flow of oil onto the cylinder walls and promotes longer liner, piston and ring life.

A uni- -directional honing pattern does not provide optimum lubrication and may result in severe

- 2. Install deglazing tool in slow- -speed drill.

NOTE: To obtain the desired cross hatch pattern adjust the speed of the drill and the up and down motion.

- 3. Stop to examine liner bore and/or take measurements (see Table 3.05-10). A precise cross hatch pattern in piston travel area is very important.
- 4. Move deglazing tool up and down entire length of liner bore for 10 to 12 complete repetitions.

- 5. Wash cylinder liner bore with liquid dishwashing soap and warm water to remove all abrasive particles and residual grit. Continue cleaning until a clean cloth shows no evidence of dirt or debris.

Compressed air can pierce the skin and cause severe injury. Never use your hand to check for leaks or to determine air flow rates. Wear safety glasses to shield your eyes from flying dirt and debris. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 6. Rinse liner with hot water and dry with compressed air.
- 7. Apply clean engine oil to inside of liner.
- 8. Cover cylinder liners with a clean plastic sheet to protect them from dust and dirt.

## LOWER CYLINDER LINER BORE

Cavitation and erosion can affect the lower cylinder liner area (see Figure 3.05-20) and prevent the cylinder liner rings from sealing. This area must be in good condition. If grooves or pockmarks have affected the area, or fretting (angular patterning) can be seen or felt, the bore must be machined and restored to standard size (requires the installation of an 'oversized' cylinder ring). This operation should only be performed by service shops that have experience in this type of repair.

The cylinder liner counterbore depth must be checked (see Table 3.05-11). The correct depth will allow the liner O- -rings to seat properly.

Cylinder liner side play cannot be tolerated. Any lateral motion, no matter how slight, will cause the cylinder liner to crack and separate at the top flange. The top flange will remain in place due to the cylinder head/flange mounting.

## FLYWHEEL

## RING GEAR REMOVAL

<!-- image -->

Always wear protective equipment when installing or removing components with an interference fit. Installation or removal of interference components may cause flying debris. Failure to use protective equipment may result in severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Do not try to pry or tap the ring gear from the flywheel. The shrink fit holds the ring gear with sufficient bond that damage to the gear will result if these methods are used.

- 1. Cut into ring gear with hack saw (see Figure 3.05-21). Do not cut into flywheel.
- 2. Insert cold chisel into cut and gently tap until ring gear splits and separates from flywheel.
- 3. Clean outer circumference of flywheel. Remove burrs or raised spots that would prevent new ring gear from seating properly.

Figure 3.05-21. Flywheel Ring Gear

<!-- image -->

## RING GEAR INSTALLATION

- 1. Position flywheel on flat surface.

NOTE: If the shop oven is not large enough, a torch may be used to heat the ring gear. If the torch is used, make sure to heat the ring gear evenly to prevent the ring gear from binding during installation.

<!-- image -->

Always wear protective equipment when installing or removing components with an interference fit. Installation or removal of interference components may cause flying debris. Failure to use protective equipment may result in severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Heated components can cause severe burns. Do not handle heated parts with bare hands. Failure to use protective equipment may result in severe personal injury or death.

- 2. Heat ring gear to approximately 300 - 350 /Gb0 F (149 -177 /Gb0 C).
- 3. Install ring gear onto flywheel before it cools.
- 4. Check flywheel balance. Balance must be within 150 gm/0.39 in. (1 cm). Any metal removed must be removed from the outer rim.

## TIMING TAPE INSTALLATION

- 1. Remove old timing tapes.
- 2. Remove any oil, grease and dirt from flywheel that would prevent proper adhesion of a new timing tape.
- 3. Align 'TDC' mark on timing tape with 'TDC 1RB- -6R' (12 cylinder engines) or 'TDC 1RB- -8R' (16 cylinder engines) stamped on flywheel. Timing tape should be readable when facing flywheel from rear.

Figure 3.05-22. Timing Tape Installation

<!-- image -->

- 4. Peel adhesive backing off timing tape.
- 5. Place top of tape (inside edge) directly behind letter 'T' in 'TDC' on rim of flywheel. Use machined lines for reference. Tightly press timing tape into place.

## CHECKING CRANKCASE TOLERANCES

## Main Bearing Bore Inspection

Themainbearing bore must be checked for wear and/or distortion, including out- -of- -round, taper, surface condition, and bore size.

Normally main bearing bores are found in alignment. Misalignment could occur if the engine had not been properly installed.

If bearing bores are not worn or damaged, or if all damaged caps have been replaced, the bore may be considered properly aligned if a standard size crankshaft can be rotated freely with the main bearings installed and lubricated, and with the bearing caps tightened to the proper torque.

Replacement bearing caps are furnished semi- -finished. They must be installed in the correct location, tightened to the proper torque, and then 'align- -bored.'

## Main Bearing Cleaning

- 1. Clean all oil passages. Make sure all 'sludge' is removed.

<!-- image -->

Compressed air can pierce the skin and cause severe injury. Never use your hand to check for leaks or to determine air flow rates. Wear safety glasses to shield your eyes from flying dirt and debris. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 2. Use compressed air to dry bearing caps and oil passages.

NOTE: Main bearing caps must be installed in their proper positions and tightened to the proper torque (in the proper sequence) before making any of these checks.

## Main Bearing Bore Inspection

After the crankshaft main bearing caps are installed (without the crankshaft), different bearing cap measurements are recorded and compared with 'known' values. The difference in values determines the condition of the main bearings and caps.

The main bearing caps are stamped with #1 through #6 for six cylinder engines and #1 through #8 for eight cylinder engines. The number stamped on the bearing cap must match the number stamped on the bearing saddle.

NOTE: Late model crankcases use two dowel pins to align the bearing caps. Early model crankcases use one dowel pin to align the bearing cap. The tightening procedures are different for single and dual dowel pin crankcases. Use the correct tightening procedure for each crankcase.

Figure 3.05-23. Dual Dowel Pin Crankcase

## MAIN BEARING CAP INSTALLATION (CRANKSHAFT REMOVED)

The main bearing caps are stamped with #1 through #6 for six cylinder engines and #1 through #8 for eight cylinder engines. The number stamped on the bearing cap must match the number stamped on the bearing saddle.

NOTE: All torques stated assume bolt threads are coated with clean engine oil. Do not use any lubricant containing molybdenum disulfide.

## SINGLE DOWEL MAIN BEARING CAPS

- 1. Apply clean engine oil to all bolt threads.
- 2. Install all main bearing caps and secure with bolts, tighten only enough to seat firmly (see Figure 4.00-9). Make sure bearing cap number matches saddle number. Slot and dowel hole in bearing cap should align with dowels in crankcase.

NOTE: Left side #5 and #6 main bearing cap crossbolts use special washers and O- -rings to seal properly. These crossbolts run through oil passages (see Figure 3.05-25). The differences are visible from the bottom of crankcase.

Figure 3.05-25. Crossbolt Oil Passage

<!-- image -->

- 3. Install and partially tighten two crossbolts adjacent to spreader on right hand side (dowel side of bearing cap only). Tighten to 37 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (50 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). Move /Gd7 spreader to new location and repeat until all right crossbolts are installed. Remove spreader.
- 4. Tighten all right side crossbolts (begin with #1) to 92 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (125 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 5. Starting with #1 main bearing, install all left side crossbolts and tighten to 37 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (50 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 6. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all left side crossbolts to 92 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (125 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 7. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all main bearing bolts to 325 /G20/Gb1 15 ft-lb (440 /G20/Gb1 20 N m). Tighten /Gd7 right bolt first, then left bolt for all remaining main bearing caps.
- 8. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all main bearing bolts to 590 /Gb1 15 ft-lb (800 /G20/Gb1 20 N m). Tighten /Gd7 right bolt first, then left bolt for all remaining main bearing caps.

## DUAL DOWEL MAIN BEARING CAPS

- 1. Install main bearing caps (see Figure 3.05-26). Make sure bearing cap number matches saddle number. Dowel holes in bearing caps should align with dowels in crankcase.

Figure 3.05-26. Main Bearing Cap Installation

<!-- image -->

- 2. Apply clean engine oil to all bolt threads.
- 3. Starting with #1 main bearing, install main bearing cap bolts and tighten to 74 ft-lb (100 N m). /Gd7
- 4. Remove spreader if installed.
- 5. Starting with #1 main bearing, install all right crossbolts and tighten to 37 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (50 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 6. Tighten all main bearing cap bolts to 147 ft-lb (200 N m) (begin with #1). Tighten right hand side first. /Gd7
- 7. Tighten all right side crossbolts (begin with #1) to 92 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (125 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- NOTE: Left side #5 and #6 main bearing cap crossbolts require special washers and O- -rings to seal properly. These crossbolts run through oil passages (see Figure 3.05-27). The differences are visible from the bottom of crankcase.
- 8. Install all left side crossbolts (begin with #1) and tighten to 37 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (50 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 9. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all left side crossbolts to 92 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (125 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 10. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all main bearing bolts to 325 /G20/Gb1 15 ft-lb (440 /G20/Gb1 20 N m). Tighten /Gd7 right bolt first, then left bolt for all remaining main bearing caps.
- 11. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all main bearing bolts to 590 /G20/Gb1 15 ft-lb (800 /G20/Gb1 20 N m). Tighten /Gd7 right bolt first, then left bolt for all remaining main bearing caps.

Figure 3.05-27. Crossbolt Oil Passage

## Main Bearing Bore Measurements

- 1. Measure and record main bearing bore inside diameter (ID) at four different locations. Use an inside micrometer (see Figure 3.05-28).

Figure 3.05-28. Measure Main Bearing Bores

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Bearings caps that exceed these tolerances are unusable and must be replaced.

- NOTE: If the crankcase main bearing bore requires re- -boring for alignment, install bearing caps without the bearings and tighten nuts to 130 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (175 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7 Torques for crossbolts remain the same (as stated in installation procedures).
- 2. Compare recorded measurements to specifications listed below:
- /Gb7 Maximum out- -of- -round measurement of 0.001 in. (0.0254 mm) is allowed if horizontal dimension exceeds vertical dimension.

- /Gb7 Maximum taper in any bearing bore is 0.0005 in. (0.0127 mm).
- /Gb7 Bore diameter should not exceed 6.574 - - 6.575 in. (167.00 - - 167.005 mm).
- 3. Inspect bearing cap surfaces. Bearing cap surfaces must be flat, free from burrs and nicks, and must match evenly when tightened. Main bearing bore finish should be 80 micro- -inches.

## Main Bearing Running Clearance

NOTE: One main bearing cap may be removed and replaced without disturbing the others. If one main bearing cap is to be installed, complete the applicable steps for tightening either dual dowel pin caps or single dowel pin caps.

<!-- image -->

When used properly, Plastigage /Ge4 is an acceptable method of measuring bearing running clearance. If the bearing clearance is greater than the capability of the Plastigage /Ge4 being used, inaccurate measurements will be obtained. Inaccurate measurements may cause bearing and/or crankshaft failure.

- 1. Measure and record main bearing crankshaft journal outside diameter (OD) at four different locations. Record both minimum and maximum diameters. Use an outside micrometer (see Figure 3.05-29).
- 2. Compare measured main bearing journal diameters with main bearing journal diameters listed in Table 3.05-13. If actual measurements exceed these specifications, then effected crankshaft journal must be ground undersized (if able) or replaced.
- 3. Insert recorded minimum/maximum bearing ID and minimum/maximumjournalOD (for each mated bearing and journal pair) into bearing thickness formulas (see Figure 3.05-31). Record calculated minimum/maximum bearing thickness.
- 4. Measureandrecordbearing crown thickness at both top and bottom bearing halves (see Figure 3.05-30). Use a micrometer with a ball adapter (for measuring spherical surfaces).
- 5. Measured bearing crown thickness must be within limits or bearing is unusable (see Table 3.05-12). Bearing side wall thickness (measured at four locations) must be 0.0000 - - 0.0007 in. (0.0000 - - 0.0178 mm) less than bearing crown thickness or bearing is unusable (see Figure 3.05-30).
- 6. Compare minimum/maximum bearing thickness to actual measured thickness. Actual measured thickness must fall within calculated minimum/maximum thickness or bearing is unusable.

## CAMSHAFT BUSHING REMOVAL

- 1. Removethree M6 x 16 mm socket head screws from front camshaft bushing (flanged).
- 2. Install camshaft bushing press (P/N 472756). Flanged bushing is pressed out from inside of crankcase. Remove front flanged bushing with press (see Figure 3.05-33).
- 3. Remove remaining camshaft bushings (non- flanged) with camshaft bushing press (see Figure 3.05-34).

## CAMSHAFT BEARING BORE INSPECTION

- 1. Measure and record camshaft bearing bore inside diameter (ID) at four different locations. Use an inside micrometer (see Figure 3.05-32).
- 2. Compare recorded measurements to specifications:
- /Gb7 Camshaft bushing bore (non- -flanged) ID should be 3.8583 - - 3.8601 in. (98.000 - - 98.047 mm).
- /Gb7 Flanged thrust bushing bore ID should be 4.0945 - - 4.0965 in. (104.000 - - 104.051 mm).

## CRANKCASE ASSEMBLY

<!-- image -->

The six cylinder crankcase weighs 1384 lb. (628 kg) and the eight cylinder crankcase weighs 1845 lb. (837 kg) completely stripped of other components. If any components are still attached, the crankcase will be heavier by the amount of the component's weight. Lift only with properly rated lifting device and rigging to avoid severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Lift the engine using the approved lifting eyes. Never lift the engine with driven or auxiliary equipment still attached. Use approved spreader and rigging procedures. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Assemble the engine in a rollover stand to provide maximum safety. The crankshaft is installed with the engine upside down. Rotating the engine block using chains and lifting devices is extremely dangerous and not recommended. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

## CRANKCASE DOWEL PIN INSTALLATION

- 1. Install bearing cap dowel pins in bearing saddle (see Figure 4.00-1).

NOTE: Current engines use two dowel pins per saddle (located on opposite sides) (see Figure 4.00-1 and Figure 4.00-2). Previous engines use one pin per saddle.

Figure 4.00-1. Crankcase Dowel Pin

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-2. Dual Dowel Pin Crankcase

<!-- image -->

## CRANKSHAFT ASSEMBLY

NOTE: Only under extreme circumstances should counterweights be removed. Counterweights are 'hand lapped' to fit their specific location. Installing counterweights in the wrong position will lead to crankshaft failure. If for some reason counterweights have been removed, see Section 3.05, Crankcase Disassembly And Overall, 'Crankshaft Counterweight Installation.'

- 1. Verify counterweight hex head screws are tightened to 210 /G20/Gb1 5 ft-lb (285 N m /Gd7 /G20/Gb1 7) (see Figure 4.00-3).
- 2. If hex head screw does not meet specified torque, inspect for damage (this includes washer).
- 3. Check hex head screw for nicks, cracks, galled or stretched threads and/or other damage. Replace if damaged.
- 4. Check washer for nicks and abrasive wear. Replace if damaged.
- 5. Make sure oil passages in crankshaft are clean. Apply Loctite /Ge2 242 to the crankshaft plugs and install plugs in the crankshaft (see Figure 4.00-4).

Figure 4.00-3. Crankshaft Counterweights

## CRANKSHAFT INSTALLATION

<!-- image -->

The six cylinder crankshaft weighs 800 lb. (362 kg). The eight cylinder crankshaft weighs 1100 lb. (498 kg). Lift only with properly rated lifting device and rigging to avoid severe personal injury or death.

NOTE: Coat your hands with clean engine oil before installing bearings to prevent skin acids from etching the bearing surface.

- 1. Install upper main bearing inserts in crankcase. Lubricate inside bearing surface (crankshaft side) with clean engine oil (see Figure 4.00-5).
- 2. Attach suitable lifting sling around connecting rod journals and lower crankshaft into crankcase (see Figure 4.00-6).

Figure 4.00-5. Upper Main Bearing

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-6. Crankshaft Rigging

<!-- image -->

## MAIN BEARING CAP INSTALLATION

The main bearing caps are stamped with #1 through #6 for six cylinder engines and #1 through #8 for eight cylinder engines. The number stamped on the bearing cap must match the number stamped on the bearing saddle.

NOTE: One main bearing cap may be removed and replaced without disturbing the others. If one main bearing cap is to be installed, complete the applicable steps for tightening either dual dowel pin caps or single dowel pin caps.

NOTE: Current crankcases use two dowel pins to align the bearing caps (see Figure 4.00-7). Previous crankcases use one dowel pin to align the bearing cap. The tightening procedures are different for single and dual dowel pin crankcases. Use the correct tightening procedures for each crankcase.

Figure 4.00-7. Dual Dowel Pin Crankcase

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Use of the crankcase spreader tool may be required when installing main bearing caps on dual dowel pin crankcases.

<!-- image -->

DO NOT spread the crankcase more than 0.006 in. (0.15 mm). Use a dial indicator to measure the spread of the crankcase sides. Disregarding this information could result in product damage.

- 1. Install crankcase spreader tool (P/N 472002). Start with bearing cap #1. Spread crankcase sides. Do not exceed 0.006 in. (0.15 mm).

Figure 4.00-8. Crankcase Spreader Tool

<!-- image -->

NOTE: All torques stated assume bolt threads are coated with clean engine oil. Do not use any lubricant containing molybdenum disulfide.

## SINGLE DOWEL MAIN BEARING CAPS

- 1. Apply clean engine oil to all bolt threads.
- 2. Install all main bearing caps and secure with bolts, tighten only enough to seat firmly (see Figure 4.00-9). Make sure bearing cap number matches saddle number. Slot and dowel hole in bearing cap should align with dowels in crankcase.

Figure 4.00-9. Main Bearing Cap Installation

<!-- image -->

- 3. Install upper and lower thrust washers on both sides of #4 (six cylinder) or #5 (eight cylinder) main bearing cap (see Figure 4.00-10).

Figure 4.00-10. Main Bearing Cap Thrust Washer

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Left side #5 and #6 main bearing cap crossbolts require special washers and O- -rings to seal properly. These crossbolts run through oil passages (see Figure 4.00-11). The differences are visible from the bottom of crankcase.

Figure 4.00-11. Crossbolt Oil Passage

<!-- image -->

- 4. Install and partially tighten two crossbolts adjacent to spreader on right hand side (dowel side of bearing cap only). Tighten to 37 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (50 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). Move /Gd7 spreader to new location and repeat until all right crossbolts are installed. Remove spreader.
- 5. Tighten all right side crossbolts (begin with #1) to 92 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (125 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 6. Starting with #1 main bearing, install all left side crossbolts and tighten to 37 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (50 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7
- 7. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all left side crossbolts to 92 /G20/Gb1 7 ft-lb (125 /G20/Gb1 10 N m). /Gd7

- 9. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten main bearing bolts to 590 /Gb1 15 ft-lb (800 /G20/Gb1 20 N m). Tighten right bolt /Gd7 first, then left bolt for all remaining main bearing caps.
- 10. Install front gear to crankshaft. Align offset hole in gear with offset hole in crankshaft. Gear must bottom on shoulder of shaft (see Figure 4.00-12).

Figure 4.00-12. Crankshaft Gear Installation

<!-- image -->

## DUAL DOWEL MAIN BEARING CAPS

- 1. Lubricate crankshaft surface of bearings with clean engine oil.
- 2. Install main bearing caps (see Figure 4.00-13). Make sure bearing cap number matches saddle number. Dowel holes in bearing caps should align with dowels in crankcase.

Figure 4.00-13. Main Bearing Cap Installation

<!-- image -->

- 3. Install upper and lower thrust washers on both sides of #4 (six cylinder) or #5 (eight cylinder) main bearing cap (see Figure 4.00-14).
- 4. Starting with #1 main bearing, install all main bearing cap bolts and tighten to 74 ft-lb (100 N m). /Gd7
- 5. Remove spreader if installed.
- 6. Install all right crossbolts and tighten to 37 /Gb1 7 ft-lb (50 /Gb1 10 N m) (begin with #1 main bearing). /Gd7
- 7. Tighten all main bearing cap bolts to 147 ft-lb (200 N m) (begin with #1). Tighten right hand side first. /Gd7
- 8. Tighten all right side crossbolts (begin with #1) to 92 /G20/Gb1/G20 7 ft-lb (125 /G20 /G20/Gb1/G20 10 N m). /G20 /Gd7
- 9. Install all left side crossbolts (begin with #1) and tighten to 37 /G20/Gb1/G20 7 ft-lb (50 /G20 /G20/Gb1/G20 10 N m). /G20 /Gd7
- NOTE: Left side #5 and #6 main bearing cap crossbolts require special washers and O- -rings to seal properly (see Figure 4.00-15). These crossbolts run through oil passages (see Figure 4.00-16). The differences are visible from the bottom of crankcase.
- 10. Starting with #1 main bearing, tighten all left side crossbolts to 92 /G20/Gb1/G20 7 ft-lb (125 /G20 /G20/Gb1/G20 10 N m). /G20 /Gd7
- 11. Tighten main bearing bolts to 325 /G20/Gb1/G20 15 ft-lb /G20 (440 /G20/Gb1/G20 20 N m) (begin with #1 main bearing). Tighten /G20 /Gd7 right bolt first, then left bolt for all remaining main bearing caps.

## CYLINDER LINER INSTALLATION

- 1. Install O- -ring seals into cylinder liner grooves. Make sure O- -ring seals are in correct order (square cut seal goes on first) (see Figure 4.00-18).
- 2. Lubricate O--rings with Parker Super- -O- -Lube /Ge4 before installing liner in crankcase. O- -ring seals must not be twisted.
- 3. Install Tool P/N 472013 onto crankcase as shown in Figure 4.00-19. Tighten center nut to press cylinder liner into crankcase bore.

Figure 4.00-18. Cylinder liner Assembly

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-19. Cylinder Liner Installation Tool

<!-- image -->

NOTE: If an O- -ring seal gets forced out of its groove during cylinder liner installation, it will actually push the cylinder liner out- -of- -round. Checking cylinder liner roundness after crankcase installation is necessary to ensure the liner seals are properly installed in their grooves.

- 4. Measure cylinder liner width (with dial bore gauge) in at least five locations inside of liner. Record measurements.
- 5. Determine if an out- -of- -round condition exists. If one measurement differs from published or actual liner internal diameter (ID) by 0.003 in. (0.076 mm) (see Table 3.05-10), then an out of round condition exists.
- 6. If cylinder liner is out of round, then remove liner and replace O- -ring seal if damaged.
- 7. Verify O--ring seals are in liner grooves. Reinstall liner and recheck cylinder bore.
- 8. Repeat above procedure for remaining cylinders.

Figure 4.00-20. Camshaft Bushing Press Installation

## CAMSHAFT BUSHINGS INSTALLATION

<!-- image -->

Make sure that both right rear and left front camshaft double bushings are installed. Omitting either bushing in these locations will cause a loss of lubricating oil to the turbochargers and the auxiliary water pump. Oil starvation results in rapid bearing failure and possible damage to the cam journal.

- 4. The front camshaft bushing is also a thrust bearing. Hold the bushing in the crankcase with three M6 x 16 socket head capscrews (see Figure 4.00-22).
- 1. Install camshaft bushing press P/N 472056 (see Figure 4.00-20).
- 2. Install camshaft bushings starting from the rear and work forward. Oil holes in bushings must align with oil supply holes in crankcase.
- 3. Hex head capscrews hold bearing shells in crankcase(seeFigure 4.00-21). Do not install screws that are too long or the screws will contact with the camshaft.

Figure 4.00-21. Cam Bearing Installation

## CYLINDER HEAD STUD INSTALLATION

NOTE: Do not install head studs dry. Do not use lubricant containing molybdenum or Loctite /Ge2 on the stud threads. Lubricate studs with clean engine oil.

- 1. Install cylinder head studs in crankcase (use a collet type stud driver). Tighten studs to 72 ft-lb (98 N m) (see /Gd7 Figure 4.00-23).

Figure 4.00-23. Cylinder Head Stud Installation

<!-- image -->

## PARALLEL PIN INSTALLATION

- 1. Install two parallel pins per cylinder (upper right and lower left). Gently tap pins in place (see Figure 4.00-24).

Figure 4.00-24. Crankcase Parallel Pin

<!-- image -->

## PISTON AND CONNECTING ROD INSTALLATION

- 1. Assemble connecting rod bushing press (P/N 472012), connecting rod and bushing as depicted (see Figure 4.00-25 and Figure 4.00-26).

NOTE: The oil supply hole in the bushing must be aligned with the oil supply hole in the connecting rod.

- 2. Tighten nut on press until bushing is fully seated in connecting rod (see Figure 4.00-26).
- NOTE: The piston pin bushing inside diameter is unfinished and must be sized to match the piston pin being used with each connecting rod.

NOTE: The pin bushing center must be located 12.204 - - 12.2047 in (309.981 - - 310.0 mm) from the center of the crankshaft bore (large end of rod), after machining. It is acceptable for the pin bushing wear surface (thickness) to be unequal between top and bottom. The center to center rod length must be maintained (see Table 3.05-9, located in Section 3.05).

<!-- image -->

Always wear safety glasses when removing piston pin retaining rings. Verify the correct retaining ring pliers is used and it is in good condition. If the retaining ring slips off the pliers when being installed or removed, it can be propelled with enough force to cause a serious eye injury. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury.

- 3. Install one retaining ring in piston (see Figure 4.00-25).
- 4. Place connecting rod inside of piston. Align 'INTAKE' mark on piston with open end of connecting rod (see Figure 4.00-25).

NOTE: The piston pins are full floating and are not a press fit. Due to manufacturing tolerances some piston pins may fit slightly tighter than others.

- 5. Insert piston pin through piston and connecting rod. Secure piston pin with remaining retaining ring.

Figure 4.00-25. Piston - - Connecting Rod

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-26. Connecting Rod Bushing Press

<!-- image -->

## PISTON RING INSTALLATION

- 4. Slide Teflon 'tube' directly behind the ring end gap (see Figure 4.00-29).

<!-- image -->

Use the proper piston ring spreader (Tool P/N 472075) to prevent excessive ring twist and expansion. Over expansion may cause the ring to crack opposite the ring gap. Defective or distorted rings result in blow- -by of exhaust gases, increased oil consumption and lower service life on components. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

<!-- image -->

Do not install used (more than 50 hours running time) piston rings. Previously used rings will not seat or wear properly. Installing used rings will result in decreased oil control and compression.

Proper piston ring installation is critical in achieving long bottom end overhaul life. Use ring expander tool P/N 472075 to install the rings on the piston.

- 1. Lightly coat pistons and rings with clean engine oil.
- 2. Install oil control ring (P/N 300705).
- 3. Install protruding 'end' of expander spring wire into oil control ring opening. This will prevent the expander spring from 'floating' (see Figure 4.00-28).
- 5. Install middle compression ring using ring expander tool P/N 472075 (see Figure 4.00-27). Middle compression ring must be installed with label 'TOP' visible.

NOTE: GSID and GL LCR engines use middle compression ring P/N 300605A. G, GL and GLD engines use middle compression ring P/N 300605.

Figure 4.00-27. Middle Compression Rings

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-28. Oil Control Ring Expander Spring

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-29. Oil Control Ring Teflon Tube

<!-- image -->

- 6. Install top compression ring (P/N 300805) using ring expander tool P/N 472075 (see Figure 4.00-30). Top compression ring must be installed with label 'TOP' visible and beveled edge on inside.
- 7. Stagger ring gaps 120 /Gb0 from each other (see Figure 4.00-30).

Figure 4.00-30. Middle Compression Rings

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-31. Piston Ring Installation

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Apply a light coat of clean engine oil to the connecting rod bearing and crankshaft journal.

NOTE: Install upper connecting rod bearing prior to installing piston assembly.

- 8. Install piston installation tool P/N 472007 onto top of piston (see Figure 4.00-32).
- 9. Install piston ring compressor P/N 472076 around piston and compress rings (see Figure 4.00-33).

Figure 4.00-32. Piston Installation Tool

<!-- image -->

Figure 4.00-33. Piston Ring Compressor P/N 472076

<!-- image -->

NOTE: Cover the end of the connecting rod with a shop rag or cloth to prevent scoring the cylinder liner when installing the pistons (see Figure 4.00-34).

Figure 4.00-34. Rod End

<!-- image -->

NOTE: The piston is marked with the word 'INTAKE' which is installed closest to the outside edge of the crankcase (see Figure 4.00-35).

10. Install piston with short end of connecting rod closest to outside edge of crankcase (see Figure 4.00-35). Piston 'intake' mark should also be closest to outside edge of crankcase.

Figure 4.00-35. Piston Installation

<!-- image -->

11. Install lower bearing insert into connecting rod cap.

NOTE: Current connecting rod bolts (P/N 304055B) should be replaced during major overhaul or if excessive overspeed, over tightening, or hydraulic lock are suspected. Previous connecting rod bolts may only be retightened three times before replacement.

12. Lubricate connecting rod bolt threads and head where it contacts rod cap with clean engine oil. Install connecting rod bolts and tighten to 310 /Gb1/G20 15 ft-lb (420 /Gb1/G20 20 N m) (see Figure 4.00-36). /Gd7

Figure 4.00-36. Connecting Rod Cap

<!-- image -->

13. Assemble and install remaining pistons.

## CONNECTING ROD INSTALLATION (WITHOUT REMOVING OIL PAN)

Installing the connecting rod capscrews through the crankcase (without removing the oil pan) requires the offset adapter P/N 472001 (see Figure 4.00-37). Improper use of the adapter can cause incorrect torque values to be applied to the connecting rod bolts during installation. See 'Offset Torque Wrench Adapter' in this section for proper use of the adapter.

## OFFSET TORQUE WRENCH ADAPTER

The removal and installation of the connecting rod cap screws through the crankcase on inline VGF engines requires the use of the offset adapter P/N 472001 (see Figure 4.00-37).

Figure 4.00-37. Offset Adapter On Connecting Rod

<!-- image -->

The offset adapter is available from the Waukesha Engine Product Training Center.

## USING THE ADAPTER CORRECTLY

Torque wrenches are constructed so that the position of the applied load can be varied on the frame or handle of the wrench. Offset adapters or extensions will not work correctly with torque wrenches without applying correction factors.

The adapter P/N 472001 has an offset of 4.25 in. (108 mm) (see Figure 4.00-38). Improper use /G20 of the adapter can cause incorrect torque values to be applied to the connecting rod bolts during installation.

The following calculations or formulas apply to either adaptors or extensions having the axis of their work engaging member intersecting the extended center line of the torque wrench frame.

The same principles apply to other offset equipment, such as crows foot wrenches.

Figure 4.00-38. Offset Adapter Dimension

<!-- image -->

NOTE: In the following examples shown the torque wrench lever length is 24 inches long. Each torque wrench has its own lever length which must be used when calculating the formulas.

The letters represent the following values when calculating the formulas.

T a = Torque exerted at the end of the adapter

T w = Wrench scale reading

L = Lever Length of the wrench

A = Length of adapter

NOTE: L and A must use similar units of measure (both in inches, millimeters, feet, etc.).

In the following examples the torque value ( T a ) is 326 ft-lb, the torque wrench length ( L ) (for this example only) is 24 inches, and the effective length of the adapter ( A ) is 4.25 inches.

To keep all the units common, convert the torque to in-lb (or the inch dimensions to feet).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## EXAMPLE 1

The adapter is installed inline with the torque wrench. The full effective length of the adapter, 4.25 inches, is added to the length of the torque wrench (see Figure 4.00-39).

Divide the inch pound reading by 12 to convert to foot pounds:

3160.359 in -lb ÷ 12 = 263.36 ft -lb The adjusted torque wrench scale reading is 263.36 ft-lb.

## EXAMPLE 2

This is the recommended configuration with the adapter installed 90 /Gb0 to the torque wrench (see Figure 4.00-40).

Because A = 0 in this configuration, the adapter has no effect on the torque wrench reading.

## EXAMPLE 3

The adapter is installed at an angle with the torque wrench. Measure the effective length of the adapter ( A ) (see Figure 4.00-41).

## SECTION 5.00

## ENGINE SPEED GOVERNING SYSTEM

## SPEED GOVERNING SYSTEM COMPONENTS

- /Gb7 PSGgovernor (engine driven hydraulic speed governor) (see Figure 5.00-3).

The engine speed control system consists of the following engine mounted components:

- /Gb7 Governor
- /Gb7 Governor drive (If equipped)
- /Gb7 Governor actuator (If equipped)
- /Gb7 Governor linkage and regulator shafts
- /Gb7 Magnetic pickup unit (Required with EG3P and 4024 governors)

## GOVERNOR

The governor controls the engine rpm by controlling the amount of air/fuel supplied to the engine. The governor speed control can be isochronous, which means that the governor will maintain a constant engine rpm regardless of load (within the capacity of the engine). The governor speed control can also operate in a droop mode which means that the governor will allow the engine to slow down slightly under load. This allows for more stable governor operation.

The governor drive is located on the back of the front gear housing. EG3P and PSG governors mount on the governor drive and turn the throttle shaft which is connected to the throttle butterfly valve. The 4024 electric governor is mounted on top of the intake manifold and linked directly to the throttle butterfly valve.

The engine may also be equipped with one of the following governors:

- /Gb7 4024 EPG governor (electrically powered governor) (see Figure 5.00-1).
- /Gb7 EG3P electro- -hydraulic governor actuator (see Figure 5.00-2), uses the following control boxes:
- /Gb7/Gb7 2301 Droop speed control
- /Gb7/Gb7 2301A Isochronous load sharing control

## AIR ACTUATOR

The engine may also be equipped with an air actuator (see Figure 5.00-10).

Figure 5.00-10. Governor Air Actuator

<!-- image -->

## Operation (with air actuator)

A signal from a pneumatic supply pressurizes the governor speed setting mechanism. The speed is determined by the amount of air pressure that is supplied to the actuator. Typical pneumatic pressure range is 3 to 15 psi (20.7 to 103.4 kPa). Governors operating at these pressures will control the engine speed between 1000 and 1800 rpm.

## AIR ACTUATOR ADJUSTMENT

The air actuator mounting has changed because of design and detail changes. The adjustment procedure remains the same with either style of actuator mounting.

- 1. Removerod connecting air actuator arm to governor lever (see Figure 5.00-11).
- 2. Adjust governor low speed stop screw for desired low idle speed.
- 3. Adjust high speed stop screw on governor for high idle that will produce rated load at rated speed.
- 4. Reduce supply air pressure to air actuator to less than minimum rated pressure. Arm should be fully retracted.
- 5. Install and adjust governor rod until governor lever is at low speed idle stop.
- 6. Remove rod from air actuator arm.
- 7. Apply 5 psi (0.03 mPa) air pressure above maximum rated pressure so that air actuator arm is fully extended.
- 8. Pull on governor rod so that governor lever is brought to full speed position.
- 9. Back off governor low speed stop screw. Air pressure to air actuator should be less than minimum rated pressure. If low speed idle is incorrect, adjust governor rod to correct length. Turn governor low speed stop screw to just barely touch and lock into position.
- 10. Back off governor high speed stop screw and apply 5 psi (0.03 mPa) air pressure above maximum rating of air actuator. If high idle speed is incorrect, adjust push rod travel adjusting screw as required and lock into position.

## GOVERNOR LINKAGE ADJUSTMENT

<!-- image -->

Before making any adjustment to an operating governor on an engine, check that you have hand throttle control over the engine speed. Failure to take adequate precautions can result in severe personal injury or death.

## PSG GOVERNING SYSTEM

NOTE: Normally, the only requirement for putting a newly overhauled PSG governor into service is adjusting the compensation needle valve to obtain maximum stability, while still maintaining good response (see Figure 5.00-19). The maximum speed may also need to be adjusted. All other operating adjustments are made during factory testing according to engine manufacturer's specifications and should not require further adjustment.

- 1. The universal spider on the regulating shaft must be 3.07 in. (78 mm) from the rear support bracket. Adjust as necessary.
- 2. Install the governor lever at angle 'C', 26 , /Gb0 with governor terminal shaft at the 'No Fuel' position and torque governor lever capscrew to 75 - 80 in-lb (8.6 N m) (see Figure 5.00-12). /Gd7
- 3. Install regulating shaft lever at angle 'D' 3 , /Gb0 and Distance 'B' with the throttle butterfly valve in the 'No Fuel' or closed position.
- 4. Install the governor rod to the governor lever.
- 5. With the governor lever at the 'No Fuel' position and butterfly held closed, adjust the threaded rod assembly so that a capscrew will pass through the rod ends and the hole in the regulating shaft lever.
- 6. Recheck the adjustments to ensure that the throttle butterfly travels from fully open to fully closed.
- 7. Check all the fasteners on the rod and levers for tightness. Governor rod thread must be engaged into the rod ends a minimum of six threads.

## MAGNETIC SPEED SENSOR INSTALLATION AND GAP ADJUSTMENT

The magnetic speed sensor reads engine speed from the flywheel teeth for use with 4024 and EG3P governors.

NOTE: Do not adjust the speed sensor gap when the engine is running or damage to the sensor will occur.

NOTE: Air actuators may require venting to remove air for proper throttle control.

<!-- image -->

Do not remove the governor lever from the governor terminal shaft. If the governor lever must be removed, carefully mark its position on the terminal shaft. Installing the governor lever in the wrong position on the terminal shaft may lead to an overspeed condition resulting in catastrophic engine damage. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

## GOVERNOR SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

Lubricate the governor control rod ends through their grease fittings. The governor drive is lubricated by engine oil and does not require external lubrication. Check the oil lines and fittings for any leaks or cracks and make repairs.

## COMPENSATION NEEDLE VALVE ADJUSTMENT - PSG ONLY

The compensation needle valve is an adjustable part of the engine speed control system. The setting of this valve affects the governor stability. It is set according to the individual characteristics of the engine.

- 1. With engine at IDLE speed, open compensation needle valve several turns until engine begins to hunt (see Figure 5.00-19). In some cases, manually disturbing the governor linkage is needed to cause the governor to move through its full stroke. Allow this hunting to occur for several minutes to remove any air trapped in the hydraulic circuits.
- 2. Slowly close compensation needle valve until speed hunting is eliminated. Keep needle valve open as far as possible to prevent any sluggishness in governor response. The needle valve setting will vary from 1/16 of aturn to 2 turns open. Never close it tight or governor will not operate properly.
- 3. Check governor stability by manually disturbing governor speed setting. Compensation adjustment is satisfactory when governor returns to speed with only a slight overshoot or undershoot. Once needle valve adjustment is correct do not change it.

## FUEL SYSTEM COMPONENTS

## COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

The engine fuel system consists of the following engine mounted components:

- /Gb7 Carburetors
- /Gb7 Throttle valves
- /Gb7 Fuel pressure regulator and balance line(s)
- /Gb7 Fuel shutoff valve

## CARBURETOR

The carburetor uses an air valve to meter the fuel gas proportionally to the air flow. A regulator controls the fuel gas supply pressure to the carburetor. A pressure range of 3 /G20/Gb1 1 in. (77.1 /G20/Gb1 25 mm) water column is typical for the F18/H24GL operating on 900 Btu LHV natural gas. A pressure range of 3 /Gb1 0.5 in. (76.2 /Gb1 12 mm) water column is typical for the F18/H24GLD operating on 900 Btu LHV natural gas.

The Impco carburetors consist of a main body with a venturi and a diaphragm operated gas metering valve (see Figure 5.05-1, Figure 5.05-2, Figure 5.05-3 and Figure 5.05-4). The amount of air passing into the engine is measured by an air- -flow measuring valve which rises proportionally to the air volume passing through the carburetor. The gas metering valve is attached to the air measuring valve which opens the gas valve proportionally to the air volume. This controls the air/fuel ratio throughout the engine speed and load range.

## SECTION 5.05

## FUEL SYSTEM

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.05-4. Impco 400 Carburetor

<!-- image -->

Deltec carburetors contain no moving parts. The main adjustment screw (MAS) controls the fuel gas to the carburetor. The carburetor consists of a main body with a perforated venturi insert that allows fuel gas to be drawn into the air stream. The size and number of the holes controls the air/fuel mixture.

GLD Deltec carburetors have low inlet restriction for improved performance. The carburetor's flat tracking provides desirable performance and low emissions and allows lean operation with low octane fuels (see Figure 5.15-8 and Figure 5.05-6).

<!-- image -->

TheDelteccarburetion system must have a positive gas shutoff valve that opens upon cranking and closes whenever engine rotation stops. The Deltec carburetor will not stop the flow of gas into the engine. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.05-6. F18/H24 GLD Deltec Fuel System

<!-- image -->

## FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR - - GL (IF EQUIPPED)

The GL engine has an S211 or Y692 cast iron regulator whichreduces the supply line pressure (25 - - 50 psi) to a carburetor inlet pressure above turbocharger boost pressure (see Figure 5.05-7). From this regulator, the fuel gas is directed to the carburetor.

Figure 5.05-7. Fuel Pressure Regulator - - S211 Shown

<!-- image -->

## FUEL SHUTOFF VALVE (IF EQUIPPED)

The fuel solenoid shutoff valve is located at the gas fuel inlet to the regulator valve (see Figure 5.05-8). This valve is electrically actuated by a safety switch powered by the magneto. An electrical signal causes the gas valve to close off the fuel supply for normal and emergency shutdowns. The latching valve should be turned 1/4 turn clockwise to latch the valve open for starting. The manual lever can be rotated clockwise to manually close the valve for shutdown.

Figure 5.05-8. Shutoff Valve

<!-- image -->

Rotate the manual lever counterclockwise to open the latch valve for starting. This causes the plunger to lift awayfromthe valve seat and latches the trip arm. When the safety switch actuates, a circuit is completed through the coil, causing a magnetic action which releases the trip arm. Spring tension forces the plunger down on the valve seat, sealing off fuel gas flow. Gas pressure on top of the plunger helps to assure a positive seal. Once the valve has operated, it must be manually reset before restarting the engine.

## CARBURETOR REMOVAL

<!-- image -->

## SECTION 5.10

## IGNITION SYSTEM - - CEC/MAGNETO

## IGNITION SYSTEM COMPONENTS

## IGNITION MODULE - - LEDS

The ignition system consists of the following components:

- /Gb7 CEC Ignition Module
- /Gb7 Hall- -effect pickup (CEC)
- /Gb7 Magneto
- /Gb7 Primary wiring harness
- /Gb7 Ignition coil
- /Gb7 Shielded ignition coil (CSA)
- /Gb7 Ignition switch
- /Gb7 Junction box
- /Gb7 Secondary wiring

## IGNITION SYSTEM COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

## IGNITION MODULE - - CEC IGNITION

The CEC Ignition Module uses a Hall- -effect pickup, a magnetic switching device to read the reference magnet disc installed on the camshaft gear. This method of timing determines the exact position of the crankshaft. The microcircuit- -based, digital CEC Ignition Module interprets the pickup's impulses to set the optimum ignition timing. The Ignition Module then directs a precisely timed voltage to the appropriate coil.

Refer to the Custom Engine Control Ignition Module Manual Form 6272 for information on the installation, operation and maintenance of the CEC Ignition Module.

Refer to Custom Engine Control Ignition Module Installation, Operation and Maintenance Manual Form 6253 for information on previous production Ignition Module (not equipped with LEDs).

The current production IM is equipped with three diagnostic LEDs located on the front of the module.

The three LEDs are labeled 'Power,' 'Pickup,' and 'Application' (see Figure 5.10-1). These LEDs give the operator a visual confirmation on (1) incoming power, (2) Hall- -effect pickup signal, and (3) proper application settings.

Figure 5.10-1. Ignition Module Diagnostic LEDs

<!-- image -->

The following LED indications are normal :

Normal operation (engine running)

- /Gb7 'Power' LED - - ON
- /Gb7 'Pickup' LED - - OFF
- /Gb7 'Application' LED - - OFF

Power applied to Ignition Module (engine not running)

- /Gb7 'Power' LED - - ON
- /Gb7 'Pickup' LED - - ON
- /Gb7 'Application' LED - - OFF

## CEC IGNITION FUSES

CEC Ignition Modules do not require fuses for safe and effective operation. If fuses are required for some reason, note the following:

- 1. Install fuse as close to power source as possible (see Figure 5.10-105 for CEC Ignition Module voltages).
- 2. Install fuse prior to junction box connection.
- 3. Do not install fuse inside of a Waukesha Engine junction box or CEC Ignition Module.
- 4. Always follow local electrical codes.

Current production engines have the Ignition Module located below the Junction Box. The Ignition Module bracket is mounted on the intake manifold (see Figure 5.10-2).

Figure 5.10-2. Current Ignition Module

<!-- image -->

Previous engines use an angled mounting bracket that located the Ignition Module above the Junction Box (see Figure 5.10-3).

Figure 5.10-3. Previous Ignition Module

<!-- image -->

## MAGNETIC TIMING DISC

The magnetic timing disc is located under a cover in the front gear housing, attached to the cam gear (see Figure 5.10-4). Trigger magnets for the Hall- -effect sensor are permanently mounted on the disc.

Figure 5.10-4. CEC Timing Disc

<!-- image -->

## HALL- -EFFECT PICKUP - - CEC IGNITION

TheHall- -effect pickup is located on the front gear cover. The pickup senses each magnet as it passes and trips the logic circuit of the CEC module to fire (see Figure 5.10-5).

Figure 5.10-5. Hall- -effect Pickup Location

<!-- image -->

## MAGNETO

The magneto is located on the engine's left side front gear housing (see Figure 5.10-6).

Figure 5.10-6. F18/H24 Magneto

<!-- image -->

The magneto uses solid state electronic components. Self- -generated alternating current is rectified to direct current and stored within a capacitor. Silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR's) function as switches to release the stored energy to the ignition coils. A trigger coil arrangement produces the voltage needed to turn on the SCR.

## WIRING HARNESS

Aflexible wiring harness is used to connect the magneto and CEC Ignition Module to the ignition coils. The wiring harness uses solderless connectors on the coil terminals and a multiple pin connector at the Ignition Module and magneto connections.

## HIGH TENSION LEADS

The standard high tension leads route the ignition secondary current from the ignition coils to the spark plugs.

## SPARK PLUGS

The spark plugs are housed within the cylinder head and ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. Spark plug life will depend on the engine operating conditions.

## MAGNETO

The magneto is the standard ignition system magneto.

As the magneto rotates, it generates alternating current (AC) that is converted (rectified) into direct current (DC). The DC energy is then stored in a capacitor. Silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR's) function as switches and release the stored energy to the ignition coils. A trigger coil arrangement produces the voltage needed to turn the SCR on.

## HALL- -EFFECT PICKUP

The Hall- -effect pickup is the standard CEC ignition pickup.

## TIMING DISC

The timing disc is the standard CEC ignition system timing disc.

## SHIELDED SPARK PLUG

Previous production shielded ignitions required a special threaded spark plug to allow installation of the integral coil. Current flange mounted coils do not require a special spark plug.

## IGNITION COILS

The ignition coils produce a high energy, long duration spark, which provides consistent cylinder firing. These coils are located either on mounting brackets on top of the intake manifolds (see Figure 5.10-7) or directly on top of the rocker arm cover (CSA) (see Figure 5.10-8).

<!-- image -->

lift the rocker cover. The coil can be damaged. Always remove the coil and spark plug extension before removing the rocker cover.

Do not use the CSA ignition coil as a handle to

Figure 5.10-8. CSA Flange Mounted Ignition Coil

<!-- image -->

NOTE: To ensure long coil life, a heat shield is required for the turbocharger and exhaust outlet (see Figure 5.10-9 and Figure 5.10-10).

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.10-10. Standard Ignition Coil Heat Shield

<!-- image -->

## HIGH TENSION WIRES

The standard high tension leads or primary shielded lead (CSA) route the ignition secondary current from the ignition coils to the spark plugs (see Figure 5.10-8).

## SPARK PLUGS

The spark plugs are located within the cylinder head and ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. Spark plug life will depend on the engine operating conditions.

## PRIMARY WIRING

Thewiring that connects the Ignition Module or magneto to the junction boxes is housed within ridged and flexible conduits. Junction boxes are used at each cylinder to provide the connections to the ignition coils (see Figure 5.10-11). The primary wiring that connects the junction boxes to the coils is housed within a steel braided wire jacket.

Figure 5.10-11. Shielded Ignition System

<!-- image -->

## IGNITION SWITCH

This explosion- -proof switch is mounted above the Ignition Module junction box. This switch is used for both normal and emergency shutdowns (see Figure 5.10-12).

<!-- image -->

Disconnect all electrical power supplies before makinganyconnectionsorservicing anypart ofthe electrical system. Electrical shock can cause severe personal injury or death.

## IGNITION SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

Spark plugs, boots, connectors, and coils must be properly maintained to preserve electrical integrity.

Wheneverservice is required on the ignition system, the boot and the O- -ring should be inspected for damage and replaced if damage is observed.

- 1. Clean ignition coil contacts at every spark plug change. If a defective coil is suspected, test by replacing ignition coil with one that is known to be good or see 'Ignition Coil Testing' in this section.
- 2. Inspect magneto drive coupling for wear or damage. Replace coupling every 4000 hours or when wear is observed.

NOTE: To help seal out moisture and prevent corrosion, use a dielectric silicone grease on the high tension connectors between the coils and the spark plug connectors.

Some acceptable dielectric greases are:

- /Gb7 Du Pont Krytox /Ge2 GPL--206
- /Gb7 G.E. G- -624
- /Gb7 GC Electronics 25
- 3. Inspect the wiring harness and connectors for moisture, corrosion, cracks, or dirt that can cause a short to ground.

Use Krytox /Ge2 GPL- -206 (P/N 489341) grease or equivalent between the boot ID and the spark plug insulator. This grease will assist in releasing the boot (P/N 740011) from the plug. Boot damage will occurif the boot is not greased. Damaged boots will allow flashover and shorten spark plug life.

NOTE: Krytox /Ge2 GPL- -206 (P/N 489341) is a higher temperature fluorinated grease manufactured by Miller- -Stephenson Chemical Co., Inc. For technical information on Krytox /Ge2 GPL- -206 call: 1- -800- -992- -2424 (8- -4 Eastern Time) or in Canada 1- -800- -323- -4621 (8- -4 Eastern Time).

The current spark plug connector, an O- -ring and a high temperature boot. Damage to the boot and the O- -ring occurs due to the extreme heat in the spark plug well. Waukesha Service Operations recommends replacement of the boot and O- -ring every six months to prevent damagetothecomponentsand/orpossiblepersonal injury.

## SPARK PLUG POLARITY

The system is designed to deliver negative voltage to the spark plug center electrode. If improper wiring causes positive voltage to be delivered to the plug, the voltage required to jump the gap may increase as much as 45%. If the ignition system cannot deliver the increased voltage, the plug will not fire. Fouling or missing will occur. The center electrode normally runs at a higher temperature than the shell electrodes. The hotter center electrode is better able to discharge a spark than the colder one. If the polarity is correct, the wear will take place on the center electrode rather than the side electrodes.

## IGNITION COILS

## IGNITION COIL REMOVAL

## Flange Mounted (CSA) Coil

- 1. Disconnect primary shielded lead from flange mounted ignition coil (see Figure 5.10-26).
- 2. Remove three M8 x 20 mm hex head screws and remove CSA coil (see Figure 5.10-26).
- 3. Remove all oil, grease and dirt from ignition coils. Pay particular attention to the area around the primary terminals. Thoroughly clean the ignition coil contacts. Use a soft brass wire brush if corrosion or an accumulation of dirt is present. Inspect contacts for damage.

Figure 5.10-26. CSA Ignition Coil

<!-- image -->

## Standard (Non- -CSA) Coil

- 1. Remove rubber boot from coil terminal connection. Remove spark plug cable from ignition coil (see Figure 5.10-27).
- 2. Remove two M8 x 16 mm hex head screws, lock washers and flat washers from ignition coil brackets. Remove wiring leads and remove coil.
- 3. Remove all oil, grease, and dirt from ignition coils. Pay particular attention to area around primary terminals. Use a soft brass wire brush if corrosion or an accumulation of dirt is present. Inspect contacts for damage.

## IGNITION COIL TESTING

<!-- image -->

Do not install, set up, maintain or operate any electrical components unless you are a technically qualified individual who is familiar with the electrical elements involved. Electrical shock can cause severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Certain tests associated with the ignition coils will create an electrical arc. Do not test coils in a combustible atmosphere. Make sure all fuel has been purged from the engine (if testing in the vicinity). Failure to comply can cause severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Keep all parts of your body away from the ignition coil when performing tests. Electrical shock can cause severe personal injury or death.

Inspect and test the ignition coils once each year.

Table 5.10- -4. Special Tools For Testing Ignition Coil

|   TOOL P/N | TOOL DESCRIPTION   |
|------------|--------------------|
|     475077 | Ignition Analyzer  |

NOTE: An ignition system troubleshooting video (Form P- -1249) or CD- -ROM (Form P- -1250) is available from the Waukesha Product Training Center that highlights the analyzer's use in practical ignition troubleshooting applications on all Waukesha engines. See the AccuTek II /Ge2 operators manual for a complete list of all ignition coil tests and engine instrument tests. Only basic ignition coil tests are listed in this manual.

- 1. Verify 24 VDC at power supply and at CEC Ignition Module. CEC Ignition Module requires 24 VDC for proper operation.

NOTE: If there is a difference of more than 1 VDC between the power supply and the Ignition Module, the engine ignition system will not function properly.

If greater than 1 VDC difference between power supply and Ignition Module:

- 1. Clean power supply and Ignition Module connections.
- 2. Clean Ignition Module ground wire connections.
- 3. Verify power supply 'ripple' is within limits. Waukesha requires 2 volts peak to peak power.

Figure 5.10-28. Ignition Module Ground Wire

## Energy Test

NOTE: One technique is to write the energy reading directly on the coil. Compare the past energy readings with those recently taken. Any coil that has an energy reading significantly different than the other coils or past readings, should be replaced. All ignition coils must be the same make and model in order to obtain accurate results.

- 1. Set test control dial on AccuTek II ignition analyzer to coil/ign.
- 2. Set measurement dial to energy.
- 3. Connect black lead to a common ground (engine block, etc.).
- 4. Connect red lead to primary coil lead (see Figure 5.10-29).
- 5. Record energy readings from each coil. Energy units are a product of peak firing voltage and duration.

Figure 5.10-29. Standard Ignition Coil

<!-- image -->

## Peak Voltage Test

- NOTE: One technique is to write the voltage readings directly on the coil. Compare the past voltage readings with those recently taken. Any coil that has a voltage reading significantly different than the other coils or past readings, should be replaced.
- 1. Set test control dial on AccuTek II ignition analyzer to coil/ign.
- 2. Set measurement dial to voltage.
- 3. Connect black lead to a common ground (engine block, etc.).
- 4. Connect red lead to shutdown (G) lead (storage capacitor) and record reading.
- 5. Connect red lead to primary coil lead and record voltage reading (see Figure 5.10-30). Repeat for remaining coils.

Figure 5.10-30. Standard Ignition Coil

<!-- image -->

- 6. Shutdown lead voltage reading should approximate coil readings (160 - - 175). If shutdown lead reading differs significantly, investigate lead and ignition wiring.
- 7. Compare readings between coils. Replace any coils that differ significantly.

## Duration Test

- NOTE: The duration test measures the IM's ability to produce current, the ability of the wiring harness to transfer current and the ability of the primary winding of the coil to accept current. Duration values of 30 microseconds ( /Gb1 4) are typical. Lower duration values indicate a ground short in the primary lead. Higher duration values indicate high resistance. Readings exceeding 6 microseconds apart are usually indicative of problems within the primary or secondary circuits of the coil.
- 1. Set test control dial on AccuTek II ignition analyzer to coil/ign.
- 2. Set measurement dial to duration.
- 3. Connect black lead to a common ground (engine block, etc.).
- 4. Non CSAConnect red lead to primary coil lead and record duration (see Figure 5.10-31).
- 5. CSADisconnect primary shielded lead from coil (see Figure 5.10-32).
- 6. CSAConnect red lead to top of CSA coil using adapter and record duration (see Figure 5.10-33).

## Missing Pulse (Misfire) Test

- 1. Set test control dial on AccuTek II ignition analyzer to coil/ign.
- 2. Set measurement dial to missing pulse.
- 3. Connect black lead to a common ground (engine block, etc).

NOTE: The ignition analyzer will shut down if 10 or more missing pulses are counted.

- 4. Non CSAConnect red lead to primary coil lead and check for missing pulses (see Figure 5.10-34).
- 5. CSAConnect red lead to primary coil lead located in conduit box and check for missing pulses (see Figure 5.10-35).

Figure 5.10-34. Standard Ignition Coil

## Insulation Integrity Test

- 1. Set test control dial on AccuTek II ignition analyzer to megger.
- 2. Set measurement dial to volts.
- 3. Press test button and set voltage to 700.
- 4. Disconnect wiring harness from junction box.

NOTE: Refer to the electrical schematics at the end of this section for 'pin' identification. Test each pin to verify insulation integrity. A reading of 100 is considered good.

- 5. Connect black lead to a common ground (engine block, etc.).
- 6. Touch red lead to each pin and check insulation integrity.

## Coil Resistance Test (Non CSA)

NOTE: The AccuTek II operations manual lists the primary and secondary resistance for all coils. Check the operations manual to verify the correct resistance specifications.

- 1. Measure primary and secondary coil winding resistance. Replace coil if either winding measurement exceeds specified tolerance.

NOTE: The resistance of the coil secondary winding is measured between the top coil terminal connection and the bottom negative (- -) terminal. The primary resistance is measured between the bottom negative (- -) terminal and the bottom positive (+) terminal (see Figure 5.10-36).

- 2. If a defective coil is suspected, then replace coil with a new one.

Figure 5.10-36. Standard Ignition Coil - - P/N 69694

<!-- image -->

## Coil Resistance Test (CSA- -Flange Mounted)

NOTE: The AccuTek II operations manual lists the primary and secondary resistance for all coils. Check the operations manual to verify the correct resistance specifications.

- 1. Measure primary resistance between 'A' and 'B' pins located on top of coil (Figure 5.10-37). Primary resistance should be 0.1 - - 0.2 ohms.

Figure 5.10-37. CSA (Flange Mounted) Coil

<!-- image -->

- 2. Measure secondary resistance between flange and high voltage (HV) cup located at bottom of coil. Secondary resistance should be 4,400 - - 6,900 ohms (see Figure 5.10-38).
- 3. If a defective coil is suspected, then replace coil with a new one.

Figure 5.10-38. CSA Flange Mounted Coil

## Coil Extension Test

<!-- image -->

Do not install, set up, maintain or operate any electrical components unless you are a technically qualified individual who is familiar with the electrical elements involved. Electrical shock can cause severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Keep all parts of your body away from the ignition coil when performing tests. Electrical shock can cause severe personal injury or death.

- 1. Connect adapter to top of coil extension. Plug lead from adapter into top of ignition analyzer.
- 2. Set test control dial on AccuTek II ignition analyzer to coil/ign.
- 3. Set measurement dial to voltage.
- 4. Press test button and adjust voltage until it reads approximately 200.
- 5. Set measurement dial to duration. Press test button.
- 6. Observe electrical arc pattern (see Figure 5.10-39).

NOTE: An electrical arc should travel from the tip of the spark plug to the bottom of the coil extension. The arc should vary in position on the coil extension (indicates no carbon tracking). The absence of an external arc indicates an electrical leak internally and repairs to the lead are required. If in doubt, compare results to a known good shielded secondary lead.

## IGNITION COIL INSTALLATION

NOTE: To help seal out moisture and prevent corrosion, use Krytox /Ge2 GPL- -206 (P/N 489341) on the high tension connectors between the coils and the spark plug connectors.

## Standard Coil (Non CSA)

- 1. Install positive and negative wiring leads. Positive leads are tagged with cylinder location number (see Figure 5.10-40).

NOTE: The lead with the yellow collar is negative (- -) and the lead with the blue collar is positive (+). To find the location of the negative and positive terminals on the coil, look for the stamp on the side of the bottom lip.

coils. The spark plugs may not fire and fouling or missing will occur. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

Do not reverse the polarity of the ignition

- 2. Verify wiring leads to each ignition coil are properly installed.
- 3. Inspect condition of spark plug cable. Replace if cable shows signs of damage.

NOTE: To help seal out moisture and prevent corrosion, use Krytox /Ge2 GPL- -206 (P/N 489341) on the high tension connectors between the coils and the spark plug connectors.

- 4. Attach spark plug cable to ignition coil.

NOTE: Make sure that the cable terminal connection bottoms out in the ignition coil contact well.

- 5. Slide rubber boot over coil terminal connection.

<!-- image -->

A poor common ground for the ignition coils can cause misfiring. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

NOTE: Four cylinders have a ground wire attached to the coil mounting bracket hex head screw. These ground leads originate from the negative coil leads and are located at cylinders #1L, #6L (or #8L), #1R and #6R (or #8R).

- 6. Verify that cylinders #1L, #6L (or #8L), #1R and #6R (or #8R) have ground wires secured to mounting brackets using M8 screws (see Figure 5.10-41).
- Flange Mounted (CSA) Coil
- 1. Always replace coil O--ring with a new O--ring whenever the coil is removed (see Figure 5.10-42).
- NOTE: When installing flange mounted CSA coils, position them on the rocker arm cover so the key way on the cannon plug will align with the ignition lead, without excessive twisting of the lead.
- 2. Install flange mounted CSA coil and O- -ring.

F18/H24GSID: 23 /Gb0  1 /Gb0 - -normal temperature cooling

Ignition timing is adjusted through two 16 position rotary switches labeled 'A' or 'B' (see Figure 5.10-85). Only one switch is active at any one time, depending on engine application.

The timing switches provide an ignition timing range from 2 to 27 degrees before top dead center (BTDC). The 16 position timing switches contain a small overlap with each other (see Table 5.10- -8).

On either timing switch ('A' or 'B'), position 15 gives the most advanced timing. Switch 'A' is able to advance the timing more than switch 'B.' At switch position 0 (zero) the timing is fully retarded. The timing advances or retards 1.0 degree between each switch position (see Table 5.10- -8).

If lead 'D' in the power pickup harness (7 pin connector) is grounded, then timing switch 'A' is active. If lead 'D' is ungrounded, then timing switch 'B' is active.

The six and eight cylinder engines have a 6 degree overlap between timing switch 'A' and timing switch 'B.' This overlap gives the Ignition Module a combined timing range of 25 degrees.

Table 5.10- -6 lists the Ignition Module firing order for six cylinder VGF engines. Table 5.10- -7 lists the Ignition Module firing for eight cylinder VGF engines.

- 1. Visually inspect the installation to be sure that all wiring conforms to the requirements of this manual, local codes, and regulatory agencies.
- 2. Verify all grounding requirements are met. See 'F18/H24 Wiring Diagrams' in this section.
- 3. Verify all power requirements are met. See 'F18/H24 Wiring Diagrams' in this section.
- 4. Removewhite caps from timing switches 'A' and 'B' located on the IM.
- 5. Non CSA OnlyInstall timing light on #1 cylinder spark plug wire.
- 6. CSAOnlyRemove cover from #1 cylinder conduit box (only if engine does not contain a timing light hookup) (see Figure 5.10-86).
- 7. CSA OnlyInstall an inductive timing light around wire labeled 'A.'

Figure 5.10-86. Conduit Box

<!-- image -->

NOTE: If the IM being adjusted is replacing another IM, set the timing switches to the same positions as the IM being replaced. For first time installations, IM timing switches 'A' and 'B' should be set to position 10. Timing selection uses the dot, not the screwdriver slot.

- 8. Check engine nameplate to determine specified engine timing.

or from position 0 to 15 while the engine is running. The timing change is so large that it may damage the engine and/or cause it to shut down. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

Do not switch from position 15 to position 0,

NOTE: Increasing the timing switch position by one will advance the timing one degree. Decreasing the timing switch position by one will retard the timing one degree.

NOTE: The active switch is determined by whether the 'D' lead in the 7 pin connector harness is grounded (switch A) or ungrounded (switch B).

## SECTION 5.15

## AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM

## AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS

## AIR FILTRATION SYSTEM (IF EQUIPPED)

The air intake filtration system removes dirt and other foreign material from air that is used for combustion. A rain shield keeps water from entering the engine. The system supplied by Waukesha is designed to meet the volume and air quality requirements of this engine (see Figure 5.15-1).

Figure 5.15-1. F18 Air Cleaner

<!-- image -->

## TURBOCHARGER

The turbocharger is mounted on the top of the exhaust manifold (see Figure 5.15-2). This high efficiency radial flow unit provides the intake air under pressure required to obtain a dense combustion chamber mixture.

Figure 5.15-2. Turbocharger

<!-- image -->

## INTERCOOLER

The intercooler is used to reduce the temperature of the air after it has been compressed by the turbocharger. This intercooler has tube and fin construction and a plenum which receives air from the turbocharger. By reducing the temperature of the air entering the engine, the charge density is increased and a denser air/fuel charge enters the cylinder. As a result more horsepower is produced for a given cylinder displacement. Cool air/fuel temperatures also help to prevent detonation (see Figure 5.15-3).

Figure 5.15-3. Intercooler

<!-- image -->

## INTAKE MANIFOLD

The intake manifold for both F18 and H24 engines is on the left side of the engine. The hand throttle and governor controlled butterfly valve are mounted on the rear of the intake manifold (see Figure 5.15-4).

Figure 5.15-4. Throttle Valve

<!-- image -->

## CARBURETOR AND INTAKE MANIFOLD

The carburetor for the F18G/GL and H24GL engine is mounted on the butterfly housing near the rear of the intake manifold (see Figure 5.15-5).

Figure 5.15-5. GL Carburetor

<!-- image -->

Thecarburetor for the F18/H24G engine uses an extension to connect to the air cleaner (see Figure 5.15-6).

Figure 5.15-6. H18G Carburetor

<!-- image -->

Thecarburetor for the F18/H24GSID engine is mounted on the air cleaner duct, on the right side of the engine. Ducting connects the carburetor to the inlet side of the turbocharger (see Figure 5.15-7).

Figure 5.15-7. F18/H24GSID Carburetor

<!-- image -->

The Deltec carburetor for GLD engines has low inlet restriction for improved performance. The carburetor's flat tracking provides desirable performance and low emissions and allows lean or rich operation with low octane fuels (see Figure 5.15-8).

Figure 5.15-8. F18/H24 GLD Deltec Fuel System

<!-- image -->

The carburetor for the F18/H24GLD (IMPCO carburetor) engine is mounted on the air cleaner duct on the right side of the engine (see Figure 5.15-9). Ducting connects the carburetor to the inlet side of the turbocharger.

Figure 5.15-9. F18/H24 GLD IMPCO 600D Carburetor

<!-- image -->

## AIR RESTRICTION INDICATOR MAINTENANCE

NOTE: It is always a good idea to check the air/fuel ratio and crankcase breather system adjustment after the air cleaner has been replaced. These systems may have been adjusted to compensate for a partially constricted air cleaner.

- 1. Check filter restriction indicator before and after engine shutdown (see Figure 5.15-10).
- 2. If filter restriction indicator shows 'red' [15 in. (38 cm) water column], then service air cleaner. See 'Air Filtration System Maintenance' in this section.
- 3. Reset indicator by depressing black button on plastic housing.

Figure 5.15-10. Air Filter Restriction Indicator

<!-- image -->

## AIR RESTRICTION INDICATOR AND ELEMENT INSPECTION

<!-- image -->

A restrictor element must be installed in the restriction indicator to dampen high pressure surges from engine backfires. Without the element the indicator may explode if the engine backfires, spreading plastic shrapnel. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 1. Remove 7/16 inch hex nut brass fitting and remove restriction indicator and element (see Figure 5.15-11).

Figure 5.15-11. GL - - Filter Restriction Indicator

<!-- image -->

- 2. Verify restrictor element is staked in place inside fitting (see Figure 5.15-12). Replace element if any damage is apparent.
- 3. Inspect plastic restriction indicator for cracks. Replace indicator if damaged or defective. Install indicator 'finger tight.'
- 4. Install restriction indicator and filter into air cleaner housing. Tighten 7/16 inch hex nut on brass fitting.

The air filter elements should be replaced according to the maintenance instructions (see Figure 5.15-13). Common sources of trouble in air intake systems are most often related to inadequate installation or a poorly maintained system.

All ducting as well as cleaner- -to- -turbocharger connections must be airtight to avoid the intake of unfiltered air.

## MAIN AIR FILTER ELEMENT CLEANING AND INSPECTION

- 1. Clean main air filter element using the following methods.
- A. Gently tap element on a flat surface with dirty side of element down.

<!-- image -->

Compressed air can pierce the skin and cause severe personal injury or death. Never use your hand to check for leaks or to determine air flow rates. Wear safety glasses to shield your eyes from flying dirt and debris.

- B. Direct compressed air through element opposite direction of normal air flow. Normal air flow direction is indicated with an orange arrow located on instruction label. Air pressure should be a maximum of 30 psi (2.1 Kg/cm 2 ).
- C. Soak element in lukewarm water and nonfoaming detergent for 10 minutes. Outlet side of element must be held above water level. Rinse element with water.
- D. Air dry element. Do not use compressed air.
- 2. Carefully examine element after cleaning. If damaged, replace.

NOTE: Use only air filter elements supplied by Waukesha.

- 3. Do not clean and reuse main air filter element more than three times. Replace with a new element.
- 4. Inspect air duct for cracks. All combustion air must pass through main air filter element, not through cracks or defects in air cleaner assembly.
- NOTE: If inspection of the intake manifold yields an accumulation of dust and grit, it is an indication that the main air filter element is not properly maintained or that air is getting into the system around or behind the element.
- 5. Inspect all air duct hoses. Replace damaged hoses.

## PRECLEANER PAD CLEANING AND INSPECTION

- 1. Wash precleaner pad with soap and water.

<!-- image -->

Compressed air can easily damage the foam rubber pad. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

- 2. Air dry pad. Do not use compressed air.

## COOLING SYSTEM

## SECTION 5.25

## COOLING SYSTEM

## AUXILIARY COOLING SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

## COOLING SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The VGF series of engines use a closed, pressure circulating cooling system which is designed to be used with a variety of external cooling devices such as radiators, cooling towers, or heat exchangers.

The engine cooling system consists of the following engine mounted components:

- /Gb7 Jacket water pump (If equipped)
- /Gb7 Auxiliary water pump (If equipped)
- /Gb7 Auxiliary water thermostatic valve
- /Gb7 Thermostat housing
- /Gb7 Jacket water heater (If equipped)
- /Gb7 Surge tank (If equipped)

Coolant is pumped through a gear driven jacket water pumpandthrough the engine crankcase inlet to provide coolant supply for the cylinder liners, cylinder heads, and water jacketed exhaust manifold.

The thermostat housing is located on the front of the exhaust manifold and contains thermostatic valves. If the coolant temperature in the engine is lower than the thermostat's setting, most of the coolant will flow through the bypass to the jacket water pump inlet. If the coolant temperature in the engine is higher than the temperature at which the thermostats start to open, coolant will flow through the open thermostatic valves and flow to the external cooling device.

The auxiliary cooling system for GSID, GL and GLD engines maintains the proper air temperature out of the intercooler and oil temperature in the oil cooler. The jacket water pump drives the auxiliary pump to circulate coolant from the intercooler to the oil cooler through external piping. Coolant leaves the intercooler and is directed to the engine mounted oil cooler. From the oil cooler, the coolant flows through the thermostatic control valve in the oil cooler bonnet. The thermostat will bypass some of this flow to the auxiliary pump or direct it to the external cooling device.

The auxiliary cooling water for G series engine oil does not use an auxiliary water pump. Instead cooling water is piped from the jacket water pump through the oil cooler and returns to the jacket water system through the water- -cooled exhaust manifold.

## JACKET WATER PUMP (IF EQUIPPED)

The gear driven jacket water pump is located on the right front of the engine (see Figure 5.25-1). An external line bleeds trapped air to the thermostat housing.

Figure 5.25-1. Jacket Water Pump

<!-- image -->

## AUXILIARY WATER PUMP (IF EQUIPPED)

The auxiliary water pump is located on the right front side of the engine and is driven by the jacket water pump (see Figure 5.25-2). The discharge is piped to the intercooler, oil cooler and the auxiliary cooling system thermostatic control valve.

Figure 5.25-2. Auxiliary Water Pump

<!-- image -->

## THERMOSTATIC VALVE HOUSING

The thermostat housing is located on the front of the engine exhaust manifold and contains three thermostatic valves (see Figure 5.25-3). The standard thermostats keep the engine at a constant working temperature of 174 - - 195 /Gb0 F (79 - - 91 /Gb0 C). If the coolant temperature in the engine is lower than the opening setting of the thermostats, most of the coolant will flow through the bypass to the jacket water pump inlet. If the coolant temperature in the engine is higher than the temperature at which the thermostats start to open, coolant will flow through the open thermostatic valves and flow to the external cooling device.

Figure 5.25-3. Jacket Water Thermostat Housing

<!-- image -->

## AUXILIARY COOLING THERMOSTATIC VALVE

The auxiliary thermostatic valve is located at the water inlet of the oil cooler on the left side of the engine (see Figure 5.25-4). The standard thermostatic valve controls the auxiliary water intercooler temperature to 130 /Gb0 F (54 /Gb0 C). When the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat will bypass the flow of coolant being discharged from the oil cooler outlet to the inlet of the auxiliary water pump.

Figure 5.25-4. Auxiliary Thermostat

<!-- image -->

## SURGE TANK (IF EQUIPPED)

An optional surge tank is available for use with closed loop cooling systems. The tank is equipped with a pressure cap, sight glass and drain cock (see Figure 5.25-5).

## COOLING SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

## COOLING SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

Ensure that the temperature of the cooling water leaving the engine (as indicated by the temperature gauge) does not exceed the temperatures listed in Table 5.25- -1. Refer to Section 6.05 Engine Protection Systems for alarm and shutdown setpoint temperatures.

Engine overheating, as evidenced by high jacket water temperatures, may be caused by one or more of the following conditions:

- /Gb7 inadequate sizing of the radiator
- /Gb7 defective thermostats
- /Gb7 worn jacket water pump
- /Gb7 excessive jacket water pump suction
- /Gb7 blown head gasket
- /Gb7 faulty temperature gauge
- /Gb7 low coolant level
- /Gb7 overloaded engine
- /Gb7 air bound system
- /Gb7 insufficient air circulation
- /Gb7 exhaust recirculation

## JACKET WATER CIRCUITS - - INITIAL FILL JACKET WATER COOLING SYSTEM

- 4. Close cooling system and run engine at idle speed.
- 5. Recheck coolant level and add additional coolant as required.

NOTE: Occasionally open the intercooler and thermostat housing air bleed petcocks in the cooling system to allow any accumulated air to escape.

<!-- image -->

Always wear protective equipment when venting the cooling system. Misuse, misapplication, or improper adjustment and maintenance of cooling fansandrelated parts can result in serious personal injury or death. Always follow basic safety precautions and proper preventive maintenance procedures.

- 6. Continue filling auxiliary cooling water circuit until level of coolant reaches top of surge tank or radiator.

Air in the cooling system speeds up the formation of rust, increases corrosion and produces hot spots within the engine. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

- 7. Bleed trapped air (see 'Cooling Water System Air Bleed' below).
- 8. Top off surge tank or radiator.

## COOLING WATER SYSTEM AIR BLEED

Air bleed the jacket water and auxiliary cooling water circuits at least once each day. Open and close the air bleed petcocks in the order that they are listed below, starting at the lowest petcock in the system and ending at the highest. Bleed one petcock at a time. The number of air bleed petcocks and their locations are as follows (see Table 5.25- -4).

Table 5.25- -4. Air Bleed Petcocks

| COOLING WATER CIRCUIT   |   NUMBER OF PETCOCKS | LOCATION                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Jacket Water            |                    1 | Cluster Thermostat Housing |
| Jacket Water            |                    1 | Jacket Water Header        |
| Auxiliary Water         |                    1 | Intercooler                |

- 1. Initial Bleed: Open each air bleed petcock prior to engine startup. A hissing sound often accompanies the escapeoftrappedair. Close petcock when hissing stops and water begins to flow out in a solid steady stream.

<!-- image -->

Always wear protective clothing when bleeding the cooling system on a heated engine. Slowly loosen the air bleed petcock to relieve any excess pressure. Escaping steam and/or hot water could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 2. Check Bleed: Start engine and reopen each petcock. Close petcock when hissing stops and water begins to flow out in a solid steady stream.
- 3. Final Bleed: Once temperature of jacket water circuit has stabilized (as indicated by the panel mounted temperature gauge), reopen each petcock. Close petcock when water begins to flow out in a solid steady stream.

<!-- image -->

Air can be drawn into the engine through small leaks in the jacket water system. The problem is compounded when the void created by the loss of coolant is filled by more air. If aeration causes the coolant to foam, the probability of engine damage due to overheating is greatly increased. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

- 4. Carefully inspect jacket water system for coolant leaks while engine is running.

## JACKET WATER AND AUXILIARY WATER CIRCUITS - - DRAIN AND FLUSH

Unless evidence of corrosion or sediment buildup demonstrates the need for more frequent maintenance, clean and flush both the jacket water and auxiliary water circuits at least once each year.

Antifreeze and water treatment products require a clean system in order to work effectively. If contaminants such as dirt, rust, scale, lime, grease, oil and/or cleaning agents are not completely flushed out, they can destroy the corrosion inhibitors and scale suppressants intended to keep freshly filled cooling systems clean.

- NOTE: To facilitate draining and flushing of the engine jacket water, replace one of the 3/4 inch NPT countersunk headless pipe plugs (just below the level of the jacket water header) with a customer supplied ball valve. The ball valve must be threaded to accept both a hose connection and pipe plug. When finished, always install a pipe plug to prevent inadvertent draining of the cooling system.
- 1. Start engine. Run engine for 10 minutes.

<!-- image -->

Always wear protective clothing when draining the cooling systems on a hot engine. As air bleed petcocks are opened, escaping steam and/or hot water could result in severe personal injury or death.

NOTE: Drain the coolant from the jacket water and auxiliary water circuits immediately after shutting down the engine. Draining the coolant immediately prevents any sediment from re- -settling.

- 2. Shut down engine. Open air bleed petcocks located at highest point in jacket water and auxiliary water circuit.
- 3. Verify that customer supplied ball valve is closed. Remove pipe plug and attach drain line.
- 4. Open ball valve and drain coolant from jacket water.
- 5. Open all air bleed petcocks (see Table 5.25- -5).
- 6. Open all water drain petcocks. Remove all drain plugs (see Table 5.25- -6).
- 7. Close all water drain petcocks. Install all drain plugs.

- 29. Carefully inspect jacket water and auxiliary cooling water circuits for leaks.

## JACKET WATER PUMP SEAL INSPECTION

- 1. Inspect 'weep hole' in bottom of water pump casting (see Figure 5.25-9). The 'weep hole' drains coolant that leaks past the ceramic water pump seal.

Figure 5.25-9. Jacket Water Pump Seal Inspection

<!-- image -->

- 2. Inspect auxiliary water pump seal at sheet metal guard (see Figure 5.25-10).

Figure 5.25-10. Auxiliary Water Pump Inspection

<!-- image -->

The presence of coolant at the 'weep hole' indicates that the water pump must be rebuilt. A defective water pump seal results in coolant loss and contamination of the inner ball bearing grease. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

- 3. Overhaul jacket water or auxiliary water pump if any leakage at 'weep hole' is observed.

## JACKET WATER PUMP ELBOWS

## WATER PUMP ELBOW REMOVAL

To service the jacket water pump or thermostat housing, the thermostat outlet connection and jacket water pump inlet elbow will have to be removed (see Figure 5.25-11 and Figure 5.25-12).

## LUBRICATION SYSTEM

## OIL FLOW DESCRIPTION

Lubricating oil is drawn from the crankcase sump through the oil pump (see Figure 5.30- -1 and Figure 5.30- -4). The high pressure oil from the pump flows past a pump mounted relief valve. The cold start relief valve bleeds excessive oil pressure to the sump. The valve starts to open at 80 psi (552 kPa) and is full open at 142 psi (797 kPa).

## SECTION 5.30

## LUBRICATION SYSTEM

The oil filter support contains the piston cooling valve. The valve blocks the flow of oil to the piston cooling jets during startup to ensure an adequate flow of oil to the engine bearings. At approximately 30 psi (207 kPa) this valve will open and supply oil to the piston cooling jets which spray oil to cool the underside of the piston crown.

Figure 5.30- -1. Oil Pump

<!-- image -->

The oil is pumped to the oil pressure regulating valve and oil cooler (see Figure 5.30- -2). The main oil pressure regulating valve is set to maintain normal operating pressure of 70 - 75 psi (414 - - 517 kPa), depending on engine speed and temperature. Normal engine idle speed pressure is 30 psi (207 kPa) minimum.

The oil flows through three full- -flow oil filter cartridges (see Figure 5.30- -3). Each cartridge is equipped with a bypass valve which opens if filter restriction exceeds 30 psi (207 kPa).

Filtered oil is then directed to the main internal oil gallery. This gallery feeds oil to the main bearings, camshaft journals, valve train and turbocharger.

Waukesha Engine strongly recommends monitoring the condition of the lube oil through the use of a good oil analysis program.

There are hundreds of commercial crankcase oils marketed today. Engine manufacturers or users cannot completely evaluate the numerous commercial oils. The current edition of the EMA Engine Fluids Data Book is available for purchase from:

Engine Manufacturers' Association

This section provides a tabulation of global lubricant producers and marketers, together with the performance classification for which the producers have indicated their products are qualified.

The Waukesha Engine Warranty is limited to the repair or replacement of parts that fail due to defective material or workmanship during the warranty period. The Waukesha Warranty does not include responsibility for lubricating oil performance.

With the exception of cogeneration and special or prototype installations, Waukesha Engine has made it a practice not to recommend oil by brand name.

## OIL DESIGNATIONS

Oil is designated in several ways: American Petroleum Institute (API), Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) performance classifications and Military Designation. Since no gas engine industry oil performance designations exist, it is the responsibility of the engine operator to verify with their oil supplier, that the oil they select has proven field performance in their specific engine make and model.

## OIL ADDITIVES

Quality oils formulated specifically for natural gas engines have sufficient additives to meet requirements. Waukesha does not recommend the addition of oil additives to these quality oils.

## OIL RECOMMENDATIONS

Waukesha recommends the use of oil formulated specifically for gas engines and meeting minimum ash requirements based on engine makes and models (see Table 5.30-1). The ash forming constituents in oil formulations provide detergency, corrosion protection, and anti- -wear protection. In addition, the ash produced during combustion of these additives will provide protection against valve face and seat recession.

gas engine oils. Waukesha Engine does not recommend gasoline or diesel oil formulations for use with its engines. Use of gasoline or diesel oil formulations may cause severe engine damage.

Waukesha engines use specifically formulated

Table 5.30-1. Oil Recommendations

| MODEL                   | SULFATED ASH % (1, 2)   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| VGF F18, H24 G, GL, GLD | 0.45 - - 0.75           |
| VGF F18, H24 GSID       | 0.35 - - 0.5            |

NOTE:

(2) Oil with 0.35% ash or less may be used in naturally aspirated and catalyst equipped naturally aspirated or turbocharged engines with the understanding that valve recession may occur, thus shortening the normally expected valve and seat life.

(1) Oils must be specifically formulated for gas engines using highly refined mineral oil base stocks. The ash requirements are a percentage by weight with both metallic andashless additive systems. A maximum of 0.10% zinc is recommended.

## CATALYST CONTAMINANTS

The following contaminants are known catalyst deactivators and should be avoided when selecting lubricating oils for installations with catalysts since they contribute to shortened catalyst life: heavy and base metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, antimony, zinc, copper, tin, iron, nickel, chrome, sulfur, and phosphorus. These individual elements should not exceed 1 ppm or collectively exceed 5 ppm at the catalyst inlet. Specific exceptions: phosphorus or silicon compounds at the catalyst inlet are not to exceed 1 ppm and sulfur compounds at the catalyst inlet are not to exceed 100 ppm.

Do not confuse the concentration of these elements AT THE CATALYST INLET with the concentration of these elements in the lube oil itself.

## OIL FILTRATION REQUIREMENTS

The quality of oil filtration will directly affect engine component life.

Waukesha's basic filtration requirement is 90% efficient at 15 microns for all full flow sock and paper elements, and 98% efficient at 25 microns for cleanable full flow metal mesh elements. Mesh or screen sizes larger than 25 microns are not acceptable.

Lube oil filter elements should be changed when the lube oil is changed or when the pressure drop across the lube oil filter exceeds 24 psi (165 kPa).

Waukesha's complete oil filter performance specification is shown in Waukesha specification sheets S08486 and S08486- -1.

## EXTENDED OIL DRAIN INTERVALS

Extended oil drain intervals are not recommended unless a Waukesha Microspin centrifuge as well as Waukesha supplied oil filtration components are installed. The Microspin centrifuge, in conjunction with Waukesha supplied oil filtration components, will remove by- -products of combustion, allowing an increase in scheduled oil drain and oil filter element change intervals. See Table 5.30-7 for the maximum number of hours between normal and extended oil drain and oil filter element change intervals.

It is recommended that oil analysis be used to determine when condemning limits are reached.

## WAUKESHA COGENERATION INSTALLATIONS

Waukesha Engine does not ordinarily recommend lube oils by brand name. However, based on actual field experience, the oils listed in Table 5.30-2 are specified for cogeneration installations with forced hot water cooling systems 212 /Gb0 F - 265 /Gb0 F (100 /Gb0 C - 129 /Gb0 C) or ebullient cooling 250 /Gb0 F (121 /Gb0 C).

It is especially important that the lube oils used in cogeneration applications use base stocks with good thermal stability. With a minimum of 4000+ hours of experience, the lube oils listed in Table 5.30-2 are knowntogivesatisfactory performance in high temperature cooling systems' applications.

Additions to the list of approved oils may be made if substantiating data is provided for an oil meeting the following criteria:

- /Gb7 Used in similar applications 212 /Gb0 F (100 /Gb0 C) to 265 /Gb0 F (129 /Gb0 C) jacket water temperatures.
- /Gb7 Minimum of 6 months operation. Documented with engine inspection data.
- /Gb7 No signs of oil degradation or lacquering problems (based on normal oil change interval, the engine should be clean).

## SOUR GAS, DIGESTER GAS, AND LANDFILL GAS RECOMMENDATIONS

<!-- image -->

Waukesha Engine assumes no liability or responsibility for damage to the environment or severe personal injury caused by using landfill gases or sour gases. It is the customer's sole responsibility to carefully analyze any gases they choose to use. Use of these gases is at the customer's own risk.

Alternate fuel sources are attracting increasing interest today as a low cost fuel or because of environmental concerns. Waukesha, being the leader in developing engine systems to accommodate these alternate fuels, is aware of problems due to sulfur compounds (H2S, etc.), siloxanes, and halide constituents in these fuels. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), siloxanes, and total organic halide as chloride (TOH/CI) bring with them totally different problems to the engine and lubricating oils.

Waukesha has limited fuel trace gases to the following:

- /Gb7 Sulfur bearing compounds (H2S, etc.) content in fuel gas to 0.1%, (1000 ppm) by volume. However, it is not unusual to encounter biomass gas or field gas with much higher percentages of sulfur bearing compounds (H2S, etc.). Gas exceeding 0.1% sulfur bearing compounds must be treated.

- /Gb7 Maximum organic halide content, expressed as chloride, (TOH/CI) in landfill gas is limited to 150 micrograms per liter ( /G6d g/l).
- /Gb7 Maximum liquid fuel hydrocarbons at the coldest expected engine mounted regulator fuel outlet temperature are limited to 2% total by gaseous volume.
- /Gb7 Maximum permissible free hydrogen content is 12% by volume.
- /Gb7 Maximum total siloxanes for engine models with a prechamber fuel system is 25 /G6d g/l. If greater than 25 /G6d g/l total siloxanes are present at the inlet to the engine mounted fuel regulator, clean commercial quality natural gas must be supplied to the prechamber fuel system. Waukesha currently does not limit total siloxane content in the fuel gas to engines which do not have a prechamber fuel system.

When dealing with halogens or halogen compounds in landfill gas, the subject becomes far too complicated to address here as it relates to the selection of a lubricating oil, used oil analysis, and drain interval. It follows that those customers operating on landfill gas review Waukesha Engine's Fuel Specification S7884- -7 (or current revision) to fully understand the ramifications of operating an engine on landfill gas. This document (as well as Service Bulletin 9- -2701) prescribes specific fuel gas sampling techniques, fuel gas analysis, handling of abrasive fuel constituents, and limitations on total organic halide as chloride, to achieve reasonable engine life. Lubricating oil requirements change as the TOH/CI increases.

## RECOMMENDED LUBE OILS FOR LANDFILL GAS APPLICATIONS

Table 5.30-3. Recommended Lube Oils Landfill Gas Applications

| BRAND                   | TYPE   |   PERCENT OF SULFATED ASH |
|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Mobil Pegasus 610 (446) | SAE 40 |                      0.98 |
| Mobil Pegasus 605 (426) | SAE 40 |                      0.48 |
| Chevron HDAX LFG        | SAE 40 |                      0.71 |

Waukesha recommends lubricating oils specifically formulated for landfill gas. However, care must be taken that oils formulated for a particular fuel type not be used beyond their recommendations. When used outside of their recommendations, some landfill gas formulated lube oils can cause excessive build- -up of abnormal ash deposits in the combustion chamber. Landfill gas engine oils should only be used for engines applied to landfill gas operation, not digester gas operation.

The best approach would be to filter or absorb corrosives in the fuel gas before they reach the engine. There are increasing claims for filtration and absorption by various companies manufacturing and promoting these types of products. Waukesha makes no endorsement of these products or service. Their performance is solely the responsibility of the manufacturers.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUEL GAS FILTRATION OF SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS

## Solid Particulate Removal:

Coalescer shall have an absolute rating of 5 microns (0.3 microns for landfill applications) for solid particulate removal.

## Liquid and Aerosol Removal From Fuel Gas:

Coalescer shall remove entrained liquid and aerosol contaminants of 0.3 µ m (micron) or larger.

- /Gb7 Fuel gas compressor lubricating oil carryover must be removed from the fuel stream. A coalescing filter with a 0.3 micron rating is adequate in most cases. Even though this oil is hydrocarbon based and combustible, it contains an additive package with calcium and other undesirable elements and compounds. Failure to remove this carryover oil can lead to fuel regulator problems, excessive spark plug and combustion chamber deposits, cylinder varnish, ring sticking, and other problems.
- /Gb7 Liquid water is not allowed in the fuel because it frequently results in fouling and corrosion. Particular attention must be paid to landfill and digester gases since these gases are commonly received saturated with water. Due to extremely small clearances in the admission and check valves, absolutely no water can be tolerated in a prechamber fuel system. To insure that no liquid water forms in the fuel system, Waukesha specifies that the dew point of the fuel gas should be at least 20 /Gb0 F (11 /Gb0 C) below the measured temperature of the gas before all engine mounted regulators and engine remote regulator pilot valves (if so equipped). On engines without prechamber fuel systems, saturated, (100% relative humidity) fuel gas at the carburetor inlet is acceptable. A 0.3 micron coalescing filter will remove any liquid water droplets being carried along with the fuel stream. The water content of the gas can then be reduced to an acceptable level by several methods.
- A. Condensation of excess moisture by refrigerating the fuel gas to no higher than 40 /Gb0 F (4 /Gb0 C) followed by filtering to remove the liquids and reheating of the gas to 85 /Gb0 - -95 /Gb0 F (29 /Gb0 - -35 /Gb0 C). This process will also remove significant amounts of halogenated and heavy hydrocarbons and volatile siloxanes.

- B. Selective stripping with a chemical process.
- C. By heating: If the gas is 30 /Gb0 F (17 /Gb0 C) or more above the ambient temperature, it can be cooled by passing it through a heat exchanger or refrigeration system, then reheated, in a manner similar to Step A. If the gas is 20 /Gb0 F (11 /Gb0 C) or more below the ambient temperature, it can be heated. In both cases, the fuel system after the heating operation should be insulated. Heating of the fuel gas is limited to the maximum allowable temperature of 140 /Gb0 F (60 /Gb0 C).
- /Gb7 Glycol is not permitted in fuel gas because it can affect the engine in adverse ways. The lubricating qualities of the oil may be reduced, resulting in bearing failure, piston ring sticking, excessive wear, and other problems. A 0.3 micron rated coalescing filter will remove liquid glycol from the fuel stream.

## Design Criteria:

Coalescer Filter Housing is to be of the cylindrical type, vertically mounted. The housing shall contain two sump chambers, such that the lower sump collects heavier liquid dropouts immediately downstream of the gas inlet, while the upper sump collects liquids draining off the coalescer cartridge(s).

The coalescer design shall use an inside to outside gas flow path through the coalescer cartridge.

The following recommendations will minimize corrosion problems normally encountered with fuel gas containing H2S and TOH/CI:

## /Gb7 Recommendation #1

Select a gas engine lubricating oil with a high alkalinity reserve, 7 to 13 TBN (Total Base Number). Alkalinity reserve in the lube oil is measured in TBN. The higher the TBN, the more reserve.

Contact your oil supplier or consult the EMA Engine Fluids Data Book for an appropriate choice. Also follow the appropriate ash content percent by weight for the specific engine model.

## /Gb7 Recommendation #2

Used oil analysis is mandatory for alternate fuel applications. Lube oil change periods are determined by TBN, TAN (Total Acid Number), oxidation, and nitration level in the used oil samples. The user must change the oil when the TBN level falls to 30% of the new oil value or TANincreases by 2.5 - 3.0 above the new oil value. The method of measuring TBN in used oil must be ASTM--D2896.

DEXSIL /Ge2 Corporation has developed the Q2000 field test kit as a test for chlorine contamination of engine oil exposed to chlorine containing fuels, as in landfill gas. This field test kit is highly accurate and allows the operator to obtain timely test results in the field. The oil must be sampled every 50 hours, in order to establish a 'trend.' Waukesha has experienced good results with this kit. Order information may be obtained from DEXSIL /Ge2 Corporation, One Hamden Park Drive, Hamden, CT 06517.

damage and or personal injury.

TOH/CI does not affect TBN levels the same as sulfur compounds. Therefore, the 70% depletion as an indicator of a change interval only applies to the applications where fuel gas does not contain halides. Disregarding this information could result in product

## /Gb7 Recommendation #3

Increase the jacket water temperature to 210 /Gb0 - -235 /Gb0 F (99 /Gb0 - -113 /Gb0 C) and lube oil temperatures to 185 /Gb0 - -200 /Gb0 F (85 /Gb0 - -93 /Gb0 C). Increased temperatures will reduce condensation, which will reduce the concentration of acids within the crankcase. High temperature thermostats are available for most models.

If you have any question on lubricants to be used with alternate fuel gases, contact the Field Service Department or Sales Engineering Department prior to selecting a lubricating oil.

## LUBE OIL CONDEMNING LIMITS

<!-- image -->

Engine oil is extremely hot and is under pressure. Use caution when sampling engine oil for analysis. Failure to follow proper procedures could cause severe personal injury or death.

Lubricating oil condemning limits are established by the engine manufacturer's experience and/or used oil testing.

Laboratory testing will determine the used oil's suitability for continued use. Used oil testing should cover the data shown in Table 5.30-4.

Table 5.30-4. Used Oil Testing And Condemnation

| TEST                                   | CONDEMNING LIMIT                                |

Actual oil change intervals to be determined by engine inspection and oil analysis in conjunction with the condemning limits. Disregarding this information could result in product damage.

In the interest of developing a reasonable life expectancy for Waukesha engines operating on fuel gas laden with some level of halogens, our experience dictates the following:

- /Gb7 To achieve the life expectancy of an engine operating on pipeline quality natural gas, remove all halogen compounds and abrasives from the fuel gas.
- /Gb7 Reasonable life can be expected if Total Organic Halide as Chloride Concentration (TOH/CI) of the fuel does not exceed 150 micrograms per liter ( /G6d g/l). Total Organic Halide as Chloride (TOH/Cl) equals the sum of all halogenated compounds expressed as chloride in micrograms/litre as chloride ( /G6d Cl/L) at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure). Reasonable life can also be expected with increased maintenance and operating adjustments to the engine.
- /Gb7 Typical changes in maintenance and operation at this level are:
- /Gb7/Gb7 Decreasedoilchangeinterval (150 hours to start)
- /Gb7/Gb7 Condemn oil when 900 ppm chlorine level in usedoil is reached. This will aid in establishing an oil change interval.
- /Gb7/Gb7 Lubricating oil analysis every 50 hours maximum
- /Gb7/Gb7 Elevated jacket water temperature 212 /Gb0 F - - 235 /Gb0 F (100 /Gb0 C - 113 /Gb0 C)
- /Gb7/Gb7 Elevated lube oil temperature to 185 /Gb0 F - 200 /Gb0 F (85 /Gb0 C - 93 /Gb0 F)
- /Gb7/Gb7 Use of high TBN oil (7.0 - - 13.0)
- /Gb7/Gb7 Bypass lubrication oil filtration. Waukesha Engine has introduced the Microspin cleanable lube oil filtering system. The Microspin system uses the cleaning capabilities of a centrifuge, coupled with cleanable filter elements. The Microspin system uses Waukesha's current lube oil filtration canister for the cleanable elements. The centrifuge is installed as a bypass system, working in conjunction with the cleanable filter elements. The Microspin centrifuge can also be used with standard filter elements.
- /Gb7 TOH/Cl above 150 micrograms chloride/litre require pre- -treatment of the fuel in order to make it suitable for use in a reciprocating engine.

DEXSIL /Ge2 Corporation has developed the Q2000 field test kit, as a test for chlorine contamination of engine oil exposed to chlorine containing fuels, as in landfill gas. This field test kit is highly accurate and allows the operator to obtain timely test results in the field. The oil must be sampled every 50 hours, in order to establish a 'trend.' Waukesha has experienced good results with this kit. Order information may be obtained from DEXSIL /Ge2 Corporation, One Hamden Park Drive, Hamden, CT 06517.

## OIL VISCOSITY SELECTION

The operating temperature of the oil in the sump or header is the best guide for selecting the proper SAE grade of oil. When the oil temperature is unknown, add 120 /Gb0 F (67 /Gb0 C) to the ambient temperature to obtain the estimated sump oil temperature.

Table 5.30-5. VGF Sump And Header Temperatures And SAE Number

| SUMP TEMPERATURES                                | HEADER TEMPERATURE                              |   SAE NUMBER |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 160 /Gb0 - - 230 /Gb0 F (71 /Gb0 - - 110 /Gb0 C) | 160 /Gb0 - - 195 /Gb0 F (71 /Gb0 - - 91 /Gb0 C) |           40 |
| Below 160 /Gb0 (71 ) /Gb0                        | Below 160 /Gb0 (71 ) /Gb0                       |           30 |

NOTE: Do not operate engines with an oil header temperature below 140 /Gb0 F (60 /Gb0 C). Engines that exceed 195 /Gb0 F (91 /Gb0 C) header temperature or 215 /Gb0 F (102 /Gb0 C) sump temperature should have reduced oil change intervals.

## MULTI- -VISCOSITY OILS

Use multi- -viscosity oils only for engines in cold starting applications. Multi- -viscosity oil may deteriorate in continuous operation, allowing the oil to lose viscosity through shearing. In this state, the oil may not supply sufficient lubricating films and/or pressure. Therefore, use an oil analysis program to determine the oil change intervals.

## SYNTHETIC OILS

Based on developments by Exxon Mobil Corporation and the release of their synthetic lubricating oils, Waukesha Engine now recognizes these products as being suitable for all Waukesha stoichiometric and lean burn gas engines. Table 5.30-2 lists the synthetic oils available.

When synthetic lubricating oils are selected, it is suggested that you contact Waukesha Engine for change interval recommendations. Typically, synthetic oil change intervals are 3 to 5 times longer than those of mineral oils. Actual change intervals must be established through oil analysis and visual inspection of engine components. Typical areas to look for oil breakdown are: exhaust valve stems, piston ring area, and piston undercrown. Oil filter change intervals remain at 1000 to 1500 hours of operation.

Synthetic oils are not recommended for digester or landfill gas applications.

## LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OPERATION

At low ambient temperatures, use an oil which will provide proper lubrication when the engine is hot and working. For engines of 1000 cu. in. (16.4 L) and above, operating at ambients below 50 /Gb0 F (10 /Gb0 C) lube oil and jacket water heaters are required to warm oil and water for fast starting and loading of engines. Waukesha Engine will supply information on these starting devices upon request.

## LUBE OIL CONSUMPTION GUIDELINES

Typical lube oil consumption rates have been updated for all Waukesha engines.

Table 5.30-6. Oil Consumption

| MODEL   | LBS/ HP- -HR     | GRAMS/ HP- -HR   | GRAMS/ kWb- -HR   |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| All     | 0.0002 - - 0.002 | 0.091 - - 0.910  | 0.121 - - 1.22    |

NOTE: Lubeoil consumption rates given above are a general guide and not meant to be used for Condemning Limits or determining overhaul requirements.

## FORMULAS FOR DETERMINING OIL CONSUMPTION RATES

## RECOMMENDED OIL CHANGE INTERVALS

<!-- image -->

ronment, marginal installation, internal engine condition and/or operating the engine with malfunctioning carburetion equipment may require more frequent oil changes. Waukesha Engine recommends that the lubricating oil be monitored with a professional oil analysis program. Extended oil change intervals may cause varnish deposits, oil oxidation, or sludge conditions to appear in the engine, which an oil analysis cannot detect. Disregarding this information could result in engine damage. Contact your local Waukesha Distributor for periodic engine maintenance.

The use of some types of oil, as well as dusty envi-

The crankcase oil level should be checked prior to each day's engine operation. The engine oil should be changed, including the oil filter elements and draining the oil cooler, every 1000 hours or sooner based on the engine's use (see Table 5.30-7, Table 5.30-8 and Table 5.30-9). The condition of the oil on the dipstick should be observed carefully. Replace oil any time it is diluted, broken down, thickened by sludge, or otherwise deteriorated. The useful life of the oil will depend on the engine load, temperature, fuel quality, atmospheric dirt, moisture and maintenance. Where oil performance problems rise or are anticipated, the oil supplier should be consulted.

Oil change intervals should not be extended beyond the recommendations (because of additive depletion) without a good oil analysis program. However, laboratory analysis is intended primarily to detect engine problems and will not predict the oil additive 'dump out' point precisely. Consequently, close attention to engine conditions by the operator is required when considering an alternate oil change interval.

## OIL CHANGE PROCEDURE

<!-- image -->

Engine oil is hot and can burn if it contacts bare skin. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 1. Remove drain plug from oil pan and drain oil while still warm.
- 2. Remove filter canisters from oil filter support (use filter wrench) (see Figure 5.30- -5).

Figure 5.30- -5. Lube Oil Filter Canisters

<!-- image -->

- 3. Drain oil from oil cooler (see Figure 5.30- -6). Replace drain plugs.
- 4. Apply a film of oil to seal ring on base of each filter canister. Spin new filter until seal ring contacts base. Turn filter 3/4 of a turn. Hand tighten only.
- 5. Fill crankcase with proper grade and viscosity of oil. Oil filler cap is located on front gear cover.
- 6. Prelube engine if equipped. If not prelube equipped crank engine over several times (without fuel or ignition) until oil pressure is indicated on oil pressure gauge. Recheck oil level with dipstick and add more oil if required (see Figure 5.30- -8).
- 7. Start engine and check for leaks around oil filters and drain plugs. Re- -tighten if necessary.

## MICROSPIN CLEANABLE LUBE OIL FILTERING SYSTEM

The Microspin system consists of two major components, a centrifuge using a removable paper insert (see Figure 5.30- -9) and cleanable oil filter elements (see Figure 5.30- -13). The Microspin system cleanable filter elements are installed in the existing lube oil filtration canister. The cleanable filter elements remove particles as small as 25 microns. The centrifuge is installed as a bypass system, working in conjunction with the cleanable filter elements. The centrifuge is driven by the engine's oil pressure. The spinning action of the centrifuge's internal turbine assembly develops a force that exceeds 2000 G's, this force squeezes the contaminants against the turbine housing. The centrifuge will remove oil contaminating particles as small as 0.5 microns. The Microspin system is more environmentally friendly than systems that utilize disposable elements. Cleaning the elements eliminates the expense of replacement elements and the cost of hazardous waste disposal. Microspin installation and maintenance parts kits are available.

Figure 5.30- -9. Microspin Centrifuge - - P/N 489300

<!-- image -->

## INITIAL MICROSPIN CENTRIFUGE INSPECTION

- 1. Inspect Microspin centrifuge for damage that may have occurred during shipping.
- 2. Remove plastic plugs from 0.5 in. (12.7 mm) supply port and 2 in. (50.8 mm) drain port.

<!-- image -->

Use caution during initial inspection of the Microspin centrifuge prior to the unit being installed. The rotor vanes are sharp and could cause severe personal injury.

- 3. Prior to installation of Microspin centrifuge, verify rotor moves freely by inserting your index finger into drain port. Lift rotor to ensure there is end play and then verify rotor spins freely. If restriction is felt, disassemble centrifuge and correct problem.
- 4. Inspect cleanable filter elements for holes or damage to filter screens.

## STARTING

To start the unit, open the oil supply valve. It will take a few minutes for the rotor to come up to speed.

## SERVICING MICROSPIN CENTRIFUGE

Initial servicing should be about four weeks after startup, sooner if the oil is heavily contaminated. A maximum buildup of 0.75 in. (19.05 mm) is allowed on the centrifuge paper insert. Noting the buildup will help in establishing a cleaning interval.

## Centrifuge

<!-- image -->

Solvents may be flammable and give off dangerous fumes. Read and follow the manufacturer's recommendations to avoid serious personal injury or death.

Under normal operating conditions, the centrifuge should be cleaned and its paper insert removed at every scheduled oil change, or as experience dictates. The centrifuge can be cleaned while the engine remains running provided the oil supply valve is shut off (see 'Disassembly Of Microspin Centrifuge' in this section for proper procedures).

## Cleanable Filter Elements

<!-- image -->

Do not use high pressure or high temperature water on one part of the filter element for prolonged periods of time. Prolonged exposure to high pressure or heat may damage the filter element.

The cleanable oil elements (see Figure 5.30- -10 and Figure 5.30- -11) should be removed from the oil filtration canister, and cleaned at every other regularly scheduled oil change or when the oil pressure differential between the canister inlet and outlet, exceeds 24 psi (165 kPa). Two methods of cleaning the filter element cleaning are recommended:

- /Gb7 Immerse filter in a parts washer and flood inside and outside of filter. Drain filter and dry with air spray.
- /Gb7 Spray inside and outside of filter with a Steam Jenny or common water spray. Drain filter and dry with air spray.

NOTE: Before moving or drying with an air spray, allow the filter to cool to room temperature. Do not bang or bounce filter ends to dislodge water or solvent.

Use of mechanical removal equipment may cause flying debris. Wear protective eye and face shields, gloves and coveralls. Failure to take adequate precautions can result in serious personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

localized overheating can result in expansion strain.

Do not blow steam throughindividual tubes;

NOTE: Inspect the oil cooler regularly. Plugged tubes or scale deposits inhibit the flow of coolant which reduces oil cooling effectiveness. Clean the oil cooler if an increase in oil temperature cannot be traced to a malfunctioning auxiliary water pump, loose belts, a faulty thermostat or excessive engine load.

The tube bundle assembly fits inside the outer shell of the oil cooler. The tubes are water passageways secured to a fixed tube sheet at the inlet bonnet end. The tube sheet is held in place between the inlet bonnet and a protruding flange on the oil cooler shell at the inlet bonnet end. The opposite end of the tube bundle is held in place by pressure between the rear bonnet and the packing seals, which encircle the rear tube sheet.

- 1. Protect all gasket and seal surfaces.
- 2. Clean the oil cooler by either mechanical or chemical means. The selected method largely depends upon the type of deposit and the materials available.

Any of the following methods may be considered:

- A. Backflushing.
- B. Circulate hot wash oil or light distillate to remove sludge or other soft deposits.
- C. Circulate hot fresh water to remove soft salt deposits.
- D. Commercialcleaning compounds may be usedto remove sludge or scale not removed by the above methods. If such compounds are used,
- then check material compatibility to avoid possible damage.
- E. Use of a high pressure water jet.
- F. Scrapers, rotating brushes or other mechanical means. Nylon brushes are preferred over wire brushes if mechanically cleaning copper alloy tubes.
- 3. Use only cold fluid for pressure testing. Hydraulic pressure may be used to locate splits or leaking joints.

## OIL COOLER ASSEMBLY

NOTE: When reassembling the oil cooler, use a new gasket on the body and cover. Be sure that the gaskets and seals are properly positioned before any attempt is made to retighten the body bolts.

- 1. Install a new O- -ring between oil cooler and filter housing (see Figure 5.30- -26).

## EXHAUST SYSTEM

## COMPONENTS

The engine exhaust system consists of the following component parts:

## SECTION 5.35

## EXHAUST SYSTEM

expansion of exhaust gases exiting the engine, the movement of the compressor wheel causes the air passing through the air cleaner enroute to the carburetor to be compressed.

- /Gb7 Exhaust manifold assembly
- /Gb7 Turbocharger
- /Gb7 Exhaust thermocouples (If equipped)
- /Gb7 Turbocharger wastegate (If equipped)

## DESCRIPTION

The exhaust port of each cylinder is connected to the water- -jacketed exhaust manifold. The water- -cooled exhaust manifold assembly is comprised of 2 or 3 segments rigidly bolted together.

Optional thermocouples are used to monitor engine exhaust temperatures. High exhaust temperatures greatly increase the potential for detonation and have a direct impact on the life of many engine components.

One thermocouple is mounted in each exhaust port of the exhaust manifold to measure the temperature of the exhaust exiting the respective cylinder head. A thermocouple is also mounted before each turbocharger and reflects the exhaust temperature of the cylinder bank (an average of the exhaust temperatures of each individual cylinder).

The leads from the exhaust thermocouples enter a thermocouple conduit. Exiting the conduit through a flexible cable, the wires lead into the back of the instrument panel where they are connected to the exhaust pyrometer selector switch. The pyrometer selector switch is used with the portable pyrometer to monitor engine exhaust temperatures.

A turbocharger is provided for GSID, GL and GLD engines. The compressor side of the turbocharger is part of the air induction system; the turbine side is part of the exhaust system. When the turbine spins through the

An exhaust wastegate is attached to the exhaust manifold. The wastegate is a load limiting device. The wastegate can also protect the turbocharger from overspeed conditions, depending on the application. At a predetermined point, intake manifold pressure counteracts the tension of a spring and a valve opens to bypass a portion of the engine exhaust pressure around the turbocharger turbine. In this way, the air intake boost pressure is held within an acceptable range.

Exhaustgasesdriving (or bypassing) the turbine exit the engine through the exhaust stack. Exhaust gases passing the flexible exhaust connection are directed into the atmosphere through customer supplied exhaust piping.

## EXHAUST SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

## MEASURING EXHAUST SYSTEM BACK PRESSURE

Monitor the exhaust system backpressure annually. The maximum backpressure must not exceed specification.

- 1. Install tubing connector into 1/4 in. NPT hole of exhaust outlet tee. Use only non- -corroding stainless steel fittings.
- 2. Secure one end of a water manometer to connector and vent free end to atmosphere. Manometer line fitting must not extend past inner surface of exhaust pipe or an inaccurate reading may result.
- 3. Measure exhaust backpressure at rated speed and load. Measurement must be taken before catalytic converter or silencer, if installed, and should be away from any bend or elbow in exhaust piping. Corrective action must be taken if backpressure exceeds specified limit.

- 4. Excessive exhaust backpressure may be due to one or more of the following conditions:
- /Gb7 undersized piping
- /Gb7 elbows, bends or sudden enlargements in the piping
- /Gb7 plugged catalytic converter
- /Gb7 pipe obstructions
- /Gb7 exit losses

## CHECKING EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURES

Exhaust temperatures can be an important diagnostics tool. A very high exhaust temperature might indicate that the air/fuel ratio is too rich. A very low temperature may mean that a cylinder is not firing.

One exhaust thermocouple is mounted in each exhaust manifold port (see Figure 5.35-1).

Figure 5.35-1. Thermocouple Conduit

<!-- image -->

A thermocouple is also mounted below the turbocharger and in the exhaust outlet (see Figure 5.35-2 and Figure 5.35-3). Six cylinder engines have 7 thermocouples and eight cylinder engines have 9 thermocouples.

Check engine exhaust temperatures for each cylinder daily. Monitor the exhaust temperatures when the engine is running at rated speed and load.

Figure 5.35-2. Exhaust Manifold Thermocouple

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.35-3. Exhaust Outlet Thermocouple

<!-- image -->

Beonthealert for wide differences between cylinders or between cylinder banks. The actual exhaust temperature readings are not as important as the variations that may occur.

NOTE: The cylinder farthest from the flywheel is the #1 cylinder. Those closest to the flywheel are the #6 or #8 cylinders.

- 1. Rotate selector switch to determine EGT of each cylinder.
- 2. Record temperature value for each cylinder.

- NOTE: To adjust 'A' dimension, loosen lock nut and turn actuator block either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on length required (see Figure 5.35-35).
- 3. Adjust 'A' dimension to required length based on elevation (see Table 5.35- -2).
- 4. Tighten actuator lock nut after adjustment is complete.
- 5. Install actuator assembly and secure with three hex head screws.
- 6. Install wastegate sensing tube into fitting on top of actuator housing.

- 7. To verify the correct 'A' dimension length, install a ∆ P pressure gauge between the compressor discharge and intake manifold (see Figure 5.35-36). The pressure gauge scale must read from 0 - 30 in. Hg (0 - 76 cm Hg) or 0 - - 15 in. psi (0 - - 103 kPa).

NOTE: If a control panel manifold pressure gauge is installed, use the intake manifold fitting on the opposite end of the manifold to install the ∆ P gauge. An alternative method would be to read the compressor discharge pressure using a standard pressure gauge then subtract the reading from the control panel manifold pressure gauge reading to obtain reserve pressure.

8. Start engine and maintain 1800 rpm at 160 psi BMEP (1103 kPa BMEP). These settings approximate a F18GL @ 400 BHP or H24 GL @ 530 BHP. Reserve pressure (compressor discharge pressure minus intake manifold pressure) should be between 8 and 10 in. Hg (20.3 - - 25.4 cm Hg). Refer to Service Bulletin 14- -2749D or latest revision for BHP estimation.

NOTE: During periods of high temperature (&gt; 100 /Gb0 For 37.7 /Gb0 C) and high humidity (&gt; 50% relative humidity) the reserve pressure will be reduced. During these high temperature and humidity periods avoid resetting the wastegate or set to 1 - 6 in. Hg (2.5 - - 15.2 cm Hg) reserve.

- 9. If reserve pressure is incorrect, remove actuator assembly and readjust dimension 'A' length (See 'Wastegate Removal' and 'Wastegate Adjustments').
- NOTE: Therelationship between reserve pressure and dimension 'A' length is as follows: 0.04 in. (1 mm) change in dimension 'A' length is equal to approximately 1 in. (25.4 mm) Hg change in reserve pressure.
- a. If the reserve pressure is too high increase the 'A' dimension.
- b. If the reserve pressure is too low decrease the 'A' dimension.

## SECTION 5.40

## CRANKCASE BREATHER SYSTEM

## CRANKCASE BREATHER SYSTEM

## OIL SEPARATOR

## COMPONENTS

The purpose of the crankcase breather system is to removecrankcaseoil vapors from the engine. There are three systems available, depending on engine model:

- /Gb7 Open
- /Gb7 Closed
- /Gb7 Closed ejector

The standard crankcase ventilation system is an open breather design. The crankcase vapors are vented to the atmosphere through an oil separator. A rain cap is used on top of the oil separator for the open systems (see Figure 5.40-1).

Figure 5.40-1. Open Breather

<!-- image -->

As the crankcase vapors and oil mist pass through the oil separator, much of the oil adheres to the steel mesh element contained in the inlet side of the separator housing (see Figure 5.40-2). This surplus oil condenses and drops into the base of the separator. The condensed oil returns to the oil pan through a drain tube in the base of the separator housing and returns to the oil pan.

Figure 5.40-2. Oil Separator

<!-- image -->

The crankcase vapors are drawn through the cellular foam contained in the outlet side of the separator and pass through breather tubes either to the venturi extractor, the intake system or to the atmosphere depending on the system.

All current production breather systems have an oil drain from the oil separator to the oil pan.

The G and Impco carburetor GLD breather systems haveabaffle box mounted on the right side of the engine next to the oil filters (see Figure 5.40-3).

Figure 5.40-3. Ventilation System Baffle Box

<!-- image -->

The closed breather design allows a slight negative pressure to be maintained in the engine crankcase. The crankcase is vented to the air cleaner on GSID and GLD models (see Figure 5.40-4).

Figure 5.40-4. Closed Breather System

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.40-5. Closed Breather System

<!-- image -->

The GSID and GLD Deltec breather systems are similar in that the right side baffle box is not used. The breather system is connected to the left side of the gear housing (see Figure 5.40-5).

Figure 5.40-6. F18/H24 Deltec GLD Breather

<!-- image -->

## VACUUM REGULATOR

The crankcase breather regulator assembly is connected to the ejector breather or venturi extractor through a tee and pipe nipple arrangement.

While the manual crankcase pressure adjustment procedures represent coarse adjustments to the breather system, the crankcase vacuum regulator automatically performs the fine adjustments that are necessary to compensate for variations in speed and load. Maintaining a negative crankcase pressure is recommended to prevent oil leaks and remove harmful vapors, but too much pressure pulls in dust and dirt.

With less load, less vacuum is required to remove crankcase vapors. When the turbocharger compressor discharge air is reduced, a floating disc or plate within the crankcase breather regulator assembly drops down to restrict the amount of outside air pulled into the system (see Figure 5.40-7).

Figure 5.40-7. Vacuum Regulator

<!-- image -->

With an increase in load, the amount of compressor discharge air from the turbochargers increases and the plate within the regulator floats up. More outside air is drawn in as the plate rises, which allows the breather system to maintain a more constant crankcase vacuum.

The closed design for the GLD and GSID allows a slight negative pressure to be maintained in the engine crankcase. Due to the draw- -thru carburetion, the crankcase is vented to the air cleaner.

## BREATHER EJECTOR

Theejector breather system has a venturi that is used to create a vacuum in the separator, baffle box and connecting tube (see Figure 5.40-8). This draws the oil vapor from the crankcase. The venturi extractor is mounted in a horizontal position at the top of the oil separator on the front of the engine. A ball valve is used to adjust the vacuum flow through the ejector.

Figure 5.40-8. GL Breather Ejector

<!-- image -->

## Closed Breather Systems

Different fuel systems and air ducts have different ways of connecting the closed breather system to the air duct.

GLD Deltec: Separator outlet tube is secured to the air cleaner duct with hose and clamps (see Figure 5.40-9).

Figure 5.40-9. Deltec Closed Breather System

<!-- image -->

GSID: Flanged separator outlet tube is secured to air cleaner duct using hex nuts (see Figure 5.40-10).

Figure 5.40-10. GLD Closed Breather System

<!-- image -->

GL: Previous production engines had an adjusting valve in the closed breather system that regulates vacuum (see Figure 5.40-11 and Figure 5.40-12).

Figure 5.40-11. Previous Closed Breather System

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.40-12. Current Closed Breather System

<!-- image -->

## CRANKCASE PRESSURE MEASUREMENT

NOTE: Measure the crankcase pressure at least once every 3 months (2160 hours).

Table 5.40- -1. Crankcase Pressure

| Open System   | zero to +3 in. (76 mm) (in. H 2 O)   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Closed System | - -3 in. (76 mm) to zero (in. H 2 O) |

## G, GL AND GLD IMPCO

NOTE: Certain engines have a baffle box attached to the side of the crankcase that draws oil vapors into the oil separator. If the engine has a baffle box attach the manometer to the baffle box.

- 1. Remove pipe plug (1/4 in. NPT) and install tube connector (see Figure 5.40-13, Figure 5.40-14 and Figure 5.40-15).

Figure 5.40-13. Ventilation System Baffle Box

<!-- image -->

NOTE: If the engine has no baffle box, install the manometer onto the upper breather tube located on the rear of the front gear housing.

Figure 5.40-14. Previous Upper Oil Separator Inlet Tube

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.40-15. Current Upper Oil Separator Inlet Tube

<!-- image -->

- 2. Install one end of water manometer onto tube connector and vent opposite end to atmosphere. Manometer line must not protrude beyond inner surface of gauge support or an inaccurate reading may result.

NOTE: Crankcase pressure can only be adjusted on engines that contain either a breather ejector or previous closed breather.

- 3. Measure crankcase pressure and perform all pressure adjustments while engine is operating at rated speed and load (see 'Crankcase Pressure Adjustment').
- 4. Remove manometer line and tube connector. Install pipe plug.

## BREATHER EJECTOR ADJUSTMENT

## CRANKCASE PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT

GL engines have an optional breather ejector system with an adjusting valve.

The breather ejector assembly uses turbocharger compressor discharge pressure to create a vacuum that pulls the oil vapors out of the crankcase. These vapors are pulled through the oil separator and then discharged into the atmosphere through the exhaust stack.

The amount of air forced through the breather ejector controls the amount of vacuum drawn. The more air, the greater the vacuum. The greater the vacuum, the higher the negative pressure in the crankcase.

Crankcase pressure is manually adjusted by turning the ball valve on breather ejector engines or by adjusting the butterfly valve on closed breather engines.

NOTE: Before starting a new or rebuilt engine, turn the adjusting valve 3/4 open. After starting the engine, install a water manometer. Adjust the valve to obtain either a positive or negative 1.5 in. (38 mm) H2O vacuum (depending on breather system).

- 1. Install a water manometer to measure crankcase pressure.
- 2. Run engine at rated speed and load.
- 3. Slowly open ball valve until recommended negative crankcase pressure is obtained (see Figure 5.40-16).
- 4. Remove engine load.
- 5. Measure crankcase pressure again. Readjust ball valve if crankcase pressure is not within specification.
- 6. Retest at rated speed and load. If crankcase pressure is within specification, remove handle to prevent inadvertently changing valve setting.

Figure 5.40-16. GL Breather Ejector

<!-- image -->

## CLOSED BREATHER BUTTERFLY VALVE ADJUSTMENT (PREVIOUS)

- 1. Install a water manometer to measure crankcase pressure.
- 2. Run engine at rated speed and load.

NOTE: A reading from - -3 in. (76 mm) to zero H 2 O is desirable at all speeds and loads.

- 3. The lever of the shaft is inline with the valve. When the lever is inline with the tube, the valve is in the wide open position. When the lever is across the tube, the valve is in the full closed position (see Figure 5.40-17).
- 4. With the engine running under normal operating conditions, open the valve until the recommended negative crankcase pressure is obtained.
- 5. Remove engine load.
- 6. Measure crankcase pressure again. Readjust valve if crankcase pressure is not within specification.
- 7. Retest at rated speed and load.

## CLOSED BREATHER SYSTEM (CURRENT GL)

With the GL closed breather system, the contaminated crankcase gases enter the oil separator (inlet) and flow through the valve diaphragm into the filter element. The valve maintains a slight negative crankcase pressure to reduce engine weeping and prevent damage to the engine seals. Soot and other contaminants are trapped by the filter element media and then the oil is separated from the air. The oil collects at the bottom of the filter housing and is returned to the crankcase through a drain hose. A check valve is incorporated into the drain hoseto prevent reverse oil flow from the crankcase. The filtered gases then flow through the oil separator outlet and into the air box inlet.

The oil separator uses a replaceable filter element that is composed of microglass fiber. When the filter becomes restricted (through normal use), the crankcase pressure will change from slightly negative to slightly positive. When this occurs a new filter element should be ordered and installed.

## Filter Element Replacement

- 1. To replace filter element, pull up on latching mechanisms while holding oil separator bottom half (see Figure 5.40-52).
- 2. Remove oil separator bottom half and filter element (see Figure 5.40-52).

NOTE: F18GL engines use replaceable filter element P/N 489604. H24GL engines use replaceable filter element P/N 489605.

- 3. Install new filter element into oil separator. Make sure O--ring is installed and seated properly (see Figure 5.40-53).
- 4. Install and 'latch' bottom half of oil separator onto top half.

## AIR/GAS STARTER LOCAL CONTROL

## CONTROL VALVE

The local control push button control valve is mounted on the control or instrument panel with guarding (see Figure 5.45-9).

Figure 5.45-9. Air/Gas Starter Control

<!-- image -->

The control valve is mounted on a button guard bracket mounted on the inside of the control panel. A second guard bracket is attached to the outside of the panel as a guard to prevent accidental actuation (see Figure 5.45-10).

Figure 5.45-10. Control Valve Mounting

<!-- image -->

The valve supply tube runs between the 'SUP(PLY)' port of the push button valve to the starter port labeled 'I' (see Figure 5.45-11).

Thevalvedelivery tube runs between the 'DEL(IVERY)' port of the push button valve to the relay valve mounted on the starter.

Figure 5.45-11. Start Push Button Valve

<!-- image -->

Vented gas is piped away from the 'EXH(AUST)' port of the push button valve, out the back of the control panel through an exhaust muffler.

<!-- image -->

When natural gas is used for engine starting through the air motor, the air motor's exhaust and breather openings should be connected and piped to a safe distance from the engine. The starter motor should be checked periodically for gas leaks at all points where gaskets and seals are used. Failure to follow proper procedures could cause severe personal injury or death.

The air/gas starter push button will vent air/gas to the atmosphere (see Figure 5.45-12). When natural gas is used for engine starting through the air motor, the air motor's push button vent exhaust must also be routed to a safe distance from the engine.

Figure 5.45-12. Air/Gas Starter Push Button Vent

<!-- image -->

Figure 5.45-13. Air/Gas Starter Local Control

<!-- image -->

## TUBE INSTALLATION

Local control air/gas starter tubes are secured to the crankcase using clips and spacers (see Figure 5.45-13 and Figure 5.45-14).

Figure 5.45-14. Air/Gas Starter Local Control Tubes

<!-- image -->

Additional clips hold the tubes together from the rear of the crankcase, over the flywheel housing. One set of clips fasten to a drilled hole in the rear lifting eye with a capscrew and spacer.

Control tubes are secured to the rear camshaft cover using a capscrew and spacer (see Figure 5.45-15).

Figure 5.45-15. Air/Gas Starter Local Control Tubes

<!-- image -->

The starter control tubes are routed along the left side of the crankcase and installed on the control valve (see Figure 5.45-16).

Figure 5.45-16. Air/Gas Starter Control

<!-- image -->

The remote start option for air/gas starters uses a solenoid valve mounted close to the starter (see Figure 5.45-17 and Figure 5.45-18). Different pressure supply and delivery tubes are used from the local control option.

The solenoid valve is mounted on a support bracket secured to the crankcase with M10 hex head screws (see Figure 5.45-17).

Figure 5.45-17. Remote Start Solenoid Valve

## ALTERNATOR

## ALTERNATOR SERVICING

Thefrequency of inspection is determined largely by the type of operating conditions. High speed operation, high temperatures and dust and dirt all increase the wear of brushes, slip rings and bearings.

At regular intervals, inspect the terminals for corrosion and loose connections. Inspect the wiring for frayed insulation, inspect the mounting bolts for tightness, and the belt for alignment, proper tension and wear. Belt tension should be adjusted on a routine basis (see Figure 5.45-20). Refer to 'Alternator V- -belt Tension' in this section for further information.

Figure 5.45-20. Alternator Adjustment

<!-- image -->

## ALTERNATOR NOISE

Noise from an alternator may be caused by worn or dirty bearings, loose mounting bolts, a loose drive pulley, a defective diode, or a defective stator. Inspect for any of these causes and repair or replace as necessary.

## V- -BELT MAINTENANCE

<!-- image -->

To prevent severe personal injury or death, always stop the unit before cleaning, servicing or repairing the unit or any driven equipment.

- 1. Always use new, matching belt sets.
- 2. When replacing belts, always replace entire set of belts, not just the ones that look worn. This will ensure proper belt operation.
- 3. To check belt tension, depress belt with your fingers. Atensioned belt will feel alive and springy. Belts that are too tight will will not deflect and loose belts will feel dead.
- 4. Keep belts at proper tension. New belts will stretch shortly after installation. Loose belts will slip, causing power loss and heat buildup. Belts that are too tight will deteriorate rapidly and wear out engine shaft bearings.
- 5. To avoid belt damage, always loosen pulley adjustment when installing belts. Never pry a belt off a pulley.

## ALTERNATOR V- -BELT TENSION

- 1. Loosenlock nut on upper end of adjusting rod. Adjust belt tension with lower nut on adjusting rod (see Figure 5.45-21).
- 2. When desired belt tension is reached, tighten adjusting rod lock nut and capscrew.

Figure 5.45-21. Alternator Belt Adjustment

<!-- image -->

NOTE: A new set of belts are adjusted to a greater tension due to tension loss which occurs during break- -in.

NOTE: These belts are a matched set and must be replaced as a pair to ensure proper operation.

## ALTERNATOR INSTALLATION

The alternator is driven by a pulley fastened to the crankshaft through the vibration dampener (see Figure 5.45-23 and Figure 5.45-25).

NOTE: Install the alternator mounting bracket before installing the vibration dampener on H24 engines. There is not enough clearance to install the hex head screws between the vibration dampener and gear housing.

## ENGINE PROTECTION SYSTEMS

## ENGINE PROTECTION SYSTEM OPERATION

## MANUAL SHUTDOWN LEVER

<!-- image -->

Always ensure that the fuel gas valve(s) are closed after engine shutdown. Failure to close fuel gas valve(s) could cause severe personal injury or death.

All engines have a manual shutdown lever located on the intake manifold elbow (Figure 6.05-1). This lever will return the engine to idle speed. Under some conditions, the engine may shut down completely when using these levers. After the engine reaches idle speed, close the fuel gas valve to completely shut down the engine. Always close the fuel gas supply after engine shutdown.

## CONTROL SWITCHES

IGNITION SWITCH

<!-- image -->

Always ensure that the fuel gas valve(s) are closed after engine shutdown. Failure to close fuel gas valve(s) could cause severe personal injury or death.

IGNITION (Emergency Stop) switch is located on the left side of the engine (Figure 6.05-2). Depressing an IGNITION (Emergency Stop) switch will stop the engine by de- -energizing the ignition and electrical fuel supply solenoid valves. Always close the fuel gas supply after engine shutdown. To restart the engine after depressing IGNITION(Emergency Stop) switch, pull the depressed shutdown switch back out to its original position.

## CUSTOMER SUPPLIED SAFETY SHUTDOWN SWITCHES

Thecontrol switches that make up the engine protection shutdown system must be supplied by the customer. Waukesha provides the following:

- /Gb7 Sensors and Thermocouples
- /Gb7 Thermocouple Junction Box
- /Gb7 Manual Shutdown Switches

<!-- image -->

Switches for alarms and automatic engine shutdown must be supplied by the customer. The sensorsprovidedareformeasuring andmonitoring temperatures and WILL NOT shut the engine down if potentially harmful temperatures are reached. Waukesha will not be responsible for any property damage or severe personal injury or death, due to the failure to follow these instructions.

Safety shutdown switches must be supplied by the customer. Safety shutdown switches must include, but are not limited to: low oil pressure, high coolant temperature, high lube oil temperature, high intake manifold air temperature, and an overspeed switch. Switches should be wired to an alarm to warn of high temperatures and low pressure, as well as provide for automatic engine shutdown if potentially harmful temperatures, pressure, or overspeed conditions exist.

NOTE: The customer supplied control switches must be incorporated into the remote engine control panel logic.

## OPTIONAL INSTRUMENT PANEL

Waukesha Engine offers an optional instrument panel (see Figure 6.05-3).

Figure 6.05-3. Optional Instrument Panel

<!-- image -->

The instrument panel includes switchgages for jacket water temperature, lube oil pressure, intake manifold temperature, intake manifold pressure, tachometer and hourmeter.

jacket water temperature are required for unattended engine operation. Additional safety switches may be needed depending on engine configuration. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

Switches that respond to low oil pressure or high

<!-- image -->

Always ensure that the fuel gas valve(s) are closed after engine shutdown. Failure to close fuel gas valve(s) could cause severe personal injury or death.

Automatic shutdown devices consist of two main parts:

- /Gb7 A sending unit which is inserted into water jacket, lubrication system, or other system to be monitored.
- /Gb7 A set of contact points located in the switchgage or related device (see Figure 6.05-4).

Figure 6.05-4. Typical Switchgage

<!-- image -->

This system is used as protection against the possibility of the engine continuing to run after the loss of oil pressure, high intake manifold temperature, or overheating of the cooling system. If the oil pressure drops below a set value or the water temperature or intake manifold above a set value, the switchgage contacts will close and trip the gas valve to shut off the engine fuel supply.

The Switchgage could also be connected to the magneto, in which case the gauge will ground out the magneto through the safety adapter as well as tripping the fuel shutoff valve. This stops the magneto from producing ignition current and turns off the fuel supply.

In either case, the engine is stopped before extensive engine damage can occur.

Table 6.05- -1 lists 'Alarm' and 'Shutdown' setpoints for various engine operating parameters. These values can be used as a guide when designing engine protection or monitoring systems.

The 'Alarm' values shown are suggested values; they can be changed to suit a specific application or measurement device.

<!-- image -->

Do not allow an engine to operate in excess of temperature shutdown limits or below pressure shutdown limits. Engine shutdown limits are set to ensure the engine will operate within its designed parameters. Engine operation outside of the shutdown limits may cause severe engine damage, severe personal injury or death.

The temperature 'shutdown' values shown in the tables are maximum permissible values which cannot be exceeded regardless of application. The pressure 'shutdown' values shown in the tables are minimum permissible values which cannot be reduced regardless of application.

Alarm and shutdown values shown are based on dry natural gas (900 Btu/cu. ft. SLHV). Refer to the following Specification Sheets and Service Bulletins (latest revision) for changes in operating temperatures when running on landfill or digester gas fuels.

- /Gb7 Specification Sheets - - S7884- -7 and S1015- -29
- /Gb7 Service Bulletins - - 9- -2702A and 12- -1880Y

By utilizing controls which simultaneously shut off the fuel supply and ignition system upon reaching a 'shutdown' value, the potential for engine damage is reduced.

## THERMOCOUPLES

## THERMOCOUPLE REPLACEMENT

Waukesha recommends that K- -type exhaust thermocouple leads with quick disconnect plugs be used on all engines (see Figure 6.05-5). Keep spare K- -type exhaust thermocouple with quick disconnect plugs in stock. Use of the quick disconnect plug allows thermocouple to be changed without removing the entire assembly.

Figure 6.05-5. Thermocouple Quick Disconnect

<!-- image -->

- 1. Loosen ferrule nuts (9/16 inch hex) to remove thermocouple from exhaust manifold (see Figure 6.05-6).

Figure 6.05-6. Thermocouple Installation

## QUICK DISCONNECT INSTALLATION

NOTE: Variations in thermocouple wire lengths adversely affect the pyrometer readings. Errors will not usually exceed /Gb1 1%of the total reading if the variations in wire length do not exceed 22 ft (6.7 m).

- 1. Remove faulty thermocouple by cutting lead (cut approximately 12 in. (30.5 cm) from stem). Do not cut thermocouple harness short. Verify there will be enough thermocouple wiring left to reach exhaust manifold (with new thermocouple lead attached).
- 2. Slide quick disconnect rubber boot over thermocouple harness.
- 3. Peel back stainless steel braid 1-1/4 in. (3.2 cm). Remove any excess material.
- 4. Peel back insulation beneath braid 3/4 in. (1.9 cm). Remove any excess material.
- 5. Separate positive and negative conductors. Positive (+) conductor is yellow and negative (- -) conductor is red.
- 6. Peel back insulation of each conductor 3/8 in. (9.5 mm) to expose bare wire. Remove any excess material.
- 7. Separate male and female ends of quick disconnect plug, if applicable.
- 8. Loosen retaining screw from side of each prong.
- 9. Slide red negative (- -) conductor into larger diameter prong until contact is made with the pinhole (see Figure 6.05-7).

- 10. Slide yellow positive (+) conductor into smaller diameter prong until contact is made with pinhole. Tighten retaining screws.
- 11. Snap male end of plug into female end.

## Thermocouple Stem (K- -type Plug)

- 1. Unthread ferrule nut (9/16 inch hex) from thermocouple connector (see Figure 6.05-8).
- 2. Disconnect male from female end of quick disconnect plug. Remove faulty thermocouple stem and discard.
- 3. Slide new ferrule nut, back ferrule and front ferrule onto thermocouple stem (see Figure 6.05-9).
- NOTE: The lip on the back ferrule must face the large end of the front ferrule (see Figure 6.05-9).
- NOTE: If possible, install the exhaust manifold thermocouple before installing the water elbow located between the cylinder head and exhaust manifold.
- 4. Inspect thermocouple connector for galled or stretched threads. Remove and discard connector if damaged.
- 5. Apply Bostik Never- -Seez /Ge2 Anti- -Seize and Lubricating Compound to thermocouple connector. Install and tighten connector in exhaust manifold.
- 6. Insert stem of thermocouple into connector and finger tighten ferrule nut.
- 7. Verify stem height is 2-7/8 in. (73 mm) (see Figure 6.05-10). Adjust if necessary.
- 8. Tighten ferrule nut. Snap male end of plug into female end.

manifold casting or an inaccurate pyrometer reading will result. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

The thermocouple must not contact the exhaust

- 3. Connect thermocouple quick disconnect plugs (see Figure 6.05-12).
- 4. Secure conduit with clamps. Use spacers to level conduit (see Figure 6.05-13). There are two sizes of conduit clamps.
- 5. Secure flexible conduit to gear housing with wire clip (see Figure 6.05-14).
- 6. Install junction box and mounting bracket onto gear housing. Secure with M10 x 55 mm and M10 x 20 mm hex head screws. Install spacer on M10 x 55 mm hex head screw (see Figure 6.05-15).

- 7. Secure flexible conduit to housing with clip (see Figure 6.05-16).
- 8. Connect flexible thermocouple conduit to junction box located on right side of engine (see Figure 6.05-16).

NOTE: The function of the thermocouple junction box (see Figure 6.05-16) is to serve as the main junction point for the wiring of engine protection shutdowns and customer wiring. When attaching the thermocouple leads to the junction box terminal blocks, all red leads are positive (+) and all yellow leads are negative (- -).

device to check the thermocouple circuit without completely disconnecting the pyrometer. Applying uncontrolled voltage to the pyrometer will damage the instrument. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

Donotuseabatterypowered test light or similar

NOTE: The thermocouple assembly consists of two wires made of dissimilar metals covered with a metal stem. A portable pyrometer measures the small electric current generated by the thermocouple and translates the voltage into a temperature reading. A thermocouple connector is mounted in the exhaust manifold and in turbocharger exhaust inlet elbow(s).

- 1. Verify electrical connections are in good condition. Wire ends and terminal connections must be clean and dry.
- 2. Verify pyrometer dial reading increases when thermocouple is heated. If dial reading decreases, then thermocouple wiring was reversed during installation.
- 3. Turn pyrometer selector to 'Off' position. Pyrometer temperature reading should be equivalent to ambient air temperature.
- 4. Remove ferrule nut from thermocouple connector (see Figure 6.05-20).
- 5. Pull thermocouple out of exhaust passage.
- 6. Check thermocouple stem for carbon buildup. If necessary, thoroughly clean thermocouple using solvent and a soft wire brush.
- 7. Insert stem of thermocouple back into exhaust passage and tighten ferrule nut.

## ENGINE OVERSPEED SHUTDOWN SYSTEM OPERATION

The engine may be equipped with an optional overspeed shutdown system. This system measures engine speed from the ignition system (CEC or magneto ignition). Waukesha adjusts the shut down speed to 15% over engine governed speed. If an optional switchgage trips and shuts down the engine, the overspeed switch will not require resetting.

Thecontrol box is mounted on the left rear mounting leg. The reset control is on the side of the control box (see Figure 6.05-21). The reset button must be depressed to restart the engine.

If the overspeed shut- down system trips, find and correct the cause before restarting the engine. Failure to do so may damage the engine or driven equipment.

In order to detect detonation or knock, Waukesha Engine has developed an electronic Custom Engine Control (CEC) Knock Detection Module (KDM) system for VGF F18/H24 GL, GLD, and GSID engines (see Figure 6.05-22). The KDM system protects Waukesha VGF spark ignited gas engines from catastrophic damage due to detonation.

NOTE: For maximum engine protection, the KDM system must be connected to a safety shutdown.

The KDM does not have all the same capabilities of the CEC Detonation Sensing Module (DSM), though it works with some of the same technologies.

## OPERATOR INTERFACE

The KDM is equipped with a light (LED) on the front panel that informs site personnel of the system status (see Figure 6.05-22). The light is on when the KDM is powered and functioning properly with the knock sensors connected. The light is off when there is a fault or there is no power to the KDM.

Figure 6.05-22. Knock Detection Module

## COMPONENTS

The KDM system includes the KDM module, two knock sensors, and harnesses that may vary depending on the application.

## IGNITION SYSTEMS SERVED

TheKDMwasdesignedtooperatewiththeCECIgnition Module (IM) or Altronic III Magneto. The KDM uses the G--lead and the positive lead of #1 coil of these systems to determine the number of cylinders and engine speed.

NOTE: Refer to KDM Custom Engine Control Detonation Sensing Module Installation, Operation, And Maintenance Manual Form 6285 for further information.

## KNOCK SENSOR INSTALLATION

- 1. Thoroughly clean knock sensor mounting hole and area around mounting hole.

<!-- image -->

must be flat, smooth (RMS 63), and be perpendicular to the drilled hole. Make sure knock sensor mounting surface is free of paint. If the knock sensor is not mounted flush with the mounting surface or if the surface is not within RMS 63, the knock sensor WILL provide incorrect signals to the DSM or KDM system.

Drilled and tapped hole (knock sensor surface)

- 2. Verify that the mounting surface is flat and smooth (RMS 63) using a Profilometer. Although it is recommended to use a Profilometer, if one is not available, lightly run your finger over mounting surface. The surface should be free of any ripples and imperfections and should be polished smooth.
- 3. IMPORTANT! When completing Step 4 and Step 5, verify that the knock sensor is seated flat against the mounting surface. See next section, 'Verifying Knock Sensor Is Seated Flat,' for necessary steps.

## VERIFYING KNOCK SENSOR IS SEATED FLAT

- 1. Use the method provided below to verify that the knock sensor is seated flat against the mounting hole surface.
- 2. Apply a very thin coat of a blueing paste, such as Permatex /Ge2 Prussian Blue (or equivalent), to seating surface of knock sensor (see Figure 6.05-24).
- 3. Complete Step 4 and Step 5 of knock sensor installation.
- 4. Remove knock sensor.
- 5. Examine imprint left by blueing agent on the crankcase and sensor seating surface.
- /Gb7 If the imprint on the crankcase and sensor seating surface is uniform, the sensor has full- -face contact with mounting surface.
- /Gb7 If the imprint on the crankcase and sensor seating surface is NOT uniform, the sensor does not have full- -face contact with mounting surface. The mounting hole will have to be plugged and re- -tapped to make the hole perpendicular to the mounting surface.
- 6. Reinstall knock sensor by completing Step 4 and Step 5 of knock sensor installation.

## CEC GENERATOR

## COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

## SECTION 6.15

## CEC GENERATOR

The solid state voltage regulator is mounted below the CEC generator.

The optional Custom Engine Control (CEC) generator system supplies voltage to the CEC Ignition Module as well as being compatible with future CEC module components.

The CEC generator system consists of the following components:

- /Gb7 Generator
- /Gb7 Wiring harness
- /Gb7 Solid state voltage regulator
- /Gb7 Battery pack

The CEC generator supplies AC power to the voltage regulator. The voltage regulator converts and regulates the power to a nominal 24 VDC (30.0 volts VDC maximum open circuit) (see Figure 6.15-1).

Figure 6.15-1. CEC Generator System

<!-- image -->

The CEC Type I generator provides more power than the Ignition Module currently requires in order to supply future CEC module needs. The CEC generator is equipped with a battery that is mounted off the engine.

The CEC Type II generator is not equipped with a battery and is used to power only the CEC Ignition Module.

## GENERATOR SERVICING

Thefrequency of inspection is determined largely by the type of operating conditions. High speed operation, high temperatures and dust and dirt all increase the wear of coupling sleeve and bearings.

At regular intervals, inspect the terminals for corrosion and loose connections. Inspect the wiring for frayed insulation. Inspect the mounting bolts for tightness.

Inspect the drive coupling for wear or damage. Replace the coupling every 4000 hours or when wear in the slots can be seen.

## COMPRESSION PRESSURE CHECK PROCEDURE

NOTE: See compression pressure check worksheet on next page.

- 1. Determine engine's compression ratio from name tag, timing tag, or by researching engine's serial number.
- 2. Using Figure 7.00-1, determine compression pressure range based on engine's compression ratio. Example: The compression pressure range for an engine with an 8.7:1 compression ratio is 190 - - 212 psi (1,310 - - 1,461 kPa).
- 3. Adjust compression pressure range for altitude by multiplying compression pressure range by correction factor (CF) (see Figure 7.00-2).
- 4. Measure engine compression using following procedure:

<!-- image -->

Ensure ignition and fuel supply are shut off before cranking engine. Failure to do so could cause serious personal injury or product damage.

- a. Shut off ignition and fuel supply to engine.
- b. Remove spark plugs.
- c. Attach an appropriate compression test device to the first cylinder to be tested.

NOTE: Using the previous example, an altitude of 5,000 ft. (1,524 m) gives a CF of 0.84. Multiplying high and low values of compression pressure range [190 psi and 212 psi (1,310 and 1,461 kPa)] by CF (0.84) gives an adjusted compression range of approximately 160 - - 178 psi (1,103 - - 1,227 kPa).

- d. With throttle wide open, crank engine at a minimum 100 rpm until gauge reading stabilizes. Record gauge reading.
- e. Repeat on remaining cylinders.
- 5. Compare measurements in Step 4 to calculations in Step 3. Average of measurements in Step 4 should fall within high and low limits calculated in Step 3. No cylinder should deviate more than 15 psi (103 kPa) from average value.

NOTE: * For ebullient cooled engines, hot water systems with engine water temperature of 200 /Gb0 F (93 /Gb0 C) or above, engines using gaseous fuel containing H 2 S in excess of published limits, or alternate fuels such as landfill gases, refer to 'Recommended Oil Change Intervals' this section or Section 5.30 Lubrication System .

## RECOMMENDED OIL CHANGE INTERVALS

The use of some types of oil, as well as dusty environment, marginal installation, internal engine condition and/or operating the engine with malfunctioning carburetion equipment may require more frequent oil changes. Waukesha Engine recommends that the lubricating oil be monitored with a professional oil analysis program. Extended oil change intervals may cause varnish deposits, oil oxidation, or sludge conditions to appear in the engine, which an oil analysis cannot detect. Disregarding this information could result in engine damage. Contact your local Waukesha Distributor for periodic engine maintenance.

## ENGINE STORAGE

Consider the following factors before deciding how much preservation is required:

- 1. Whether the engine was used, the length of service since the last oil change.
- 2. The period of time the engine is likely to be idle or inoperative.
- 3. The atmospheric conditions at the time and place of storage. For example, the storage problems encountered in a tidewater warehouse will differ greatly from those that may be experienced in a dry and dusty location.
- 4. The hostility of the environment and the accessibility of the equipment for periodic inspection. An engine on a showroomfloor that is turned over and oiled occasionally requires less treatment than an engine abandoned in a dusty warehouse.

## WAUKESHA ENGINE PRESERVATIVE OIL

During storage, protect internal metal surfaces from the effects of dampness, salt and other corrosive substances. Waukesha Engine Preservative Oil (P/N 166709A) offers a practical and economical solution to these storage problems. It contains volatile corrosion- -inhibiting chemicals that slowly vaporize and diffuse throughout any closed void. The chemicals form an invisible protective layer on all surfaces contacted and allow the engine to be safely stored for one year.

<!-- image -->

Waukesha Preservative Oil contains a petroleum distillate which is harmful or fatal if swallowed. If taken internally, do not induce vomiting. Remove ingested material by gastric lavage with 2 to 4 quarts or litres of tap water or milk. Follow with fruit juice or vinegar to neutralize the alkali. Failure to follow these precautions could cause severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Avoid prolonged or repeated breathing of vapor. Vapor is harmful and may cause irritation to eyes, noseandthroat.Useonlywithadequateventilation. If affected by exposure, move to fresh air immediately and get medical help. Failure to follow these precautions could cause severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. If skin contact occurs, immediately flush the affected area with plenty of water. If eye contact occurs, flush for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention. If clothing is contaminated, remove and wash before using again. Failure to follow these precautions could cause severe personal injury or death.

<!-- image -->

Keep container closed and away from heat. Always read and observe the CAUTION labels on the containers. Do not remove or deface the container labels. Failure to follow these precautions could cause severe personal injury or death.

## PRESERVATIVE OIL USAGE

- 1. Verify engine temperature is below 100 \_ F (37 \_ C).

NOTE: The preservative oil will do an effective job only if added to clean engine oil. If a high sulfur fuel or a corrosive oil was used in the engine, change the oil and then run the engine long enough to ensure complete circulation of the clean oil.

- 2. Verify both oil and oil filter elements are clean.
- 3. Add Waukesha Engine Preservative Oil (P/N 166709A) to existing crankcase oil. Preservative oil should equal 2% of total oil capacity (see Table 7.05- -9).
- 4. If possible, crank engine for at least 20 seconds to ensure adequate circulation of preservative oil.
- 5. Add preservative oil to each cylinder through spark plug holes. Install spark plugs.
- 6. Remove rocker arm cover and brush or pour preservative oil onto cylinder heads. Replace rocker arm covers.

NOTE: While it may not be practical to completely seal an engine in the field, try to block the paths through which any vaporized preservative oil may escape.

- 7. Engine may be stored for one year. If storage is to exceed this period, inspect engine annually and repeat preservation routine.

## OTHER PRESERVATIVE OILS AND MATERIALS

<!-- image -->

Do not heat preservative compounds to temperatures that exceed 200 /Gb0 F (93 /Gb0 C). Direct heating always presents a dangerous and unnecessary fire hazard. Failure to follow these precautions could cause severe personal injury or death.

In addition to Waukesha Engine Preservative Oil, the preservative oils listed in Table 7.05- -7 will also protect the internal engine components. The properties that make an oil suitable for preservative requirements are good aging stability; high resistance to gumming, oxidation and polymerization; low pour point and viscosity; freedom from acids, asphalts, resins, tars, water and other contaminants.

Waukesha Engine Preservative Oil is not formulated as a protective coating for external surfaces. Excellent products for polished and machined surfaces are available on the market and should be used when needed (see Table 7.05- -8).

## ENGINE STORAGE - - NEW

NOTE: Engines stored according to these instructions using Waukesha Engine Preservative Oil will normally be protected for one year. If storage is to exceed this period, inspect the engine annually and repeat the preservation routine.

## OPERATIONAL

## Internal Component Protection

- 1. Mix an inhibitive type preservative oil with clean engine oil (use ratio recommended by manufacturer). Run engine until oil is hot.
- 2. Treat cooling water with proper inhibitors recommended by manufacturer.
- 3. Drain oil and cooling water while still hot.
- 4. Remove spark plugs and pour 1-1/2 oz. (45 cc) of preservative oil into each cylinder.

NOTE: For extra protection, remove the rocker arm covers and pour a quantity of preservative oil over the rocker arm and valve mechanisms.

- 5. Refill crankcase with proper engine oil/preservative mixture.

## External Component Protection

- 1. Engine should be clean and dry.
- 2. Apply masking tape or similar material over engine openings (air cleaners, exhaust outlets, breathers, magneto vents, open line fittings, etc.).
- 3. Relieve tension on all belts to avoid deterioration.
- 4. Useabrushandapply heavypreservative coating to all exposed machined surfaces (i.e. flywheels).
- 5. Protect accessory equipment (carburetors, gas regulators, magnetos, starters, generators, fan belts, etc.) from corrosion, dirt, moisture and deterioration.
- 6. Protect cooling system and intercoolers against freezing, rusting or seizure of water pump seals.
- 7. Protect against rain, snow and temperature extremes.
- 8. Disconnect batteries and place indoors. Place batteries on a wood board, never cement. Connect 'trickle' charger or similar device to keep batteries fully charged.

## NON- -OPERATIONAL

- 1. Drain all oil and water from engine.
- 2. Remove spark plugs and pour 1-1/2 oz. (45 cc) of preservative oil into each cylinder.
- 3. Crank engine in normal direction about 1/4 turn, then lubricate each cylinder again. Repeat procedure at least eight times or until engine has been turned two complete revolutions.
- 4. Remove all access doors, valve rocker covers, gear cover plates and spray, squirt or pour oil over interior engine parts. Replace all plugs and covers removed.

## ENGINE STORAGE - - USED

## OPERATIONAL

During normal engine operation, residues of various combustion products accumulate in the combustion area and in the lubricating oil. Portions of these residues combine with atmospheric moisture to form acids and other corrosive compounds. The following treatment will help reduce damage from this source:

- 1. Run engine until oil is hot. Drain oil.
- 2. For best results, refill engine with a good flushing oil. Run engine until flushing oil is hot. Drain both oil and cooling water while still hot.
- 3. Refill crankcase with proper engine oil/preservative mixture.
- 4. Remove spark plugs and add 45 cc (1-1/2 oz.) of preservative oil to each cylinder/combustion chamber (see Table 7.05- -9). Replace spark plugs.

## NON- -OPERATIONAL

- 1. Protect fuel system against gumming effects of gas residues.

NOTE: In those cases where fuels with high sulfur concentrations have been used or where extremely harsh climatic or environmental conditions prevail, the engine may need to be disassembled, thoroughly cleaned and then reassembled for treatment as a new engine.

## ENGINES RETURNED TO SERVICE AFTER STORAGE

Never attempt to start an engine that has been stored without first cranking it over with the spark plugs removed. Any oil, water or preservative compound that might spurt from these openingsmustberemovedtopreventahydraulic lock. Disregarding this information could result in product damage and/or personal injury.

<!-- image -->

Never attempt to start an engine that has been stored without first cranking it over with the spark plugs removed. Any oil, water or preservative compound that might spurt from these openings must be removed to prevent a hydraulic lock. Continue to crank the engine with the starter until liquid is no longer being ejected from the openings. Inspect the intake passages and manifolds for thickened preservative oil. Accumulations of this type may thin out as the engine warms up and be burned as fuel, resulting in a runaway engine. Disregarding this information could result in severe personal injury or death.

- 1. Remove old spark plugs and crank engine over to remove any accumulation of oil, water or preservative compounds.
- 2. Crank engine with starter until liquid is no longer ejected from openings.
- 3. Inspect intake passages and manifolds for thickened preservative oil.
- 4. Install new spark plugs.

Refer to VGF 6, 8, 12 &amp; 16 Cylinder Operation And Maintenance Manual Form 6284 'Prestart Inspection and Start- -up Procedures' for complete instructions to bring an engine into active service. The steps needed are about the same as those normally carried out on a new engine.
