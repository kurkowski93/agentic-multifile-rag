## Electrical System

SMCS Code: 1000; 1400

Never disconnect any charging unit circuit or battery circuit cable from the battery when the charging unit is operating. A spark can cause the combustible gases that are produced by some batteries to ignite.

When the engine is started from an external source, follow this procedure: first, connect the positive jump start cable from the external power source to the positive battery terminal of the engine that is being started. Then connect the negative jump start cable from the external power source to the negative terminal of the starting motor.  This will help to prevent sparks from igniting combustible gases that are produced by some batteries.

Check the electrical wires daily for wires that are loose or frayed.  Tighten all loose electrical wires before the engine is operated. Repair all frayed electrical wires before the engine is started.

## Grounding Practices

The electrical systems for the generator; the engine and the control systems must be properly grounded. Proper grounding is necessary for optimum performance and reliability: Improper grounding will result in uncontrolled electrical circuit paths and in unreliable electrical circuit paths.

i01032808

Uncontrolled electrical circuit paths can result in damage to main bearings; to the surface of crankshaft journals; and to aluminum components. Uncontrolled electrical circuit paths can also cause electrical activity that may degrade the performance of the generator set's electronics.

The alternator and the starting motor must be grounded to the negative battery terminal.

A ground plate with a direct path to the negative battery terminal may be used as a common ground for the components of one engine system.

For engines with an alternator that is grounded to an engine component; a ground strap must connect that component to the negative battery terminal. Also; that component must be electrically isolated from the engine.

The ground strap for the alternator must be of a size that is adequate for carrying the full charging current of the alternator.

## Generator Lead Connections

SMCS Code: 4450

## Lead Numbering

The Wye (Star) configurations and the Delta configurations\_are the most common generator lead connections.  The following three-phase connection diagrams illustrate the proper connection and lead identification.

The leads are numbered clockwise from the and from the outside inward. The diagrams show lead numbering for the six and twelve lead generators. top

Terminals Tô and T9 become the neutral connection when the terminals are tied together and grounded.This reflects the terminal T2 and T10 connection as the high phase.

## Grounding the Frame

In any generator set installation, the frame of the generator must be positively connected to an earth ground.  This connection is the first one that is made at the installation:.  This connection is the last one that should be removed. The ground connection must be flexible in order to avoid possible breakage in later operation.

Ground connection cable or straps should have at least the current carrying capacity of the largest line lead to the connected load. Joints in cables or straps must be clean; free of electrical resistance; and protected from possible oxidation. Bolted ground connection joints eventually oxidize. The joints are frequent sources of radio frequency interference (RFI). Silver soldered and bolted joints are electrically and mechanically sound.

## Neutral Connections

The generators with grounded configuration usually have the neutral grounded when the generator is installed. However; there are some cases when definite measures can be taken in order to prevent ground faults on the load side.  The purpose of the grounding of the neutral is to prevent load side equipment damage. The purpose of the grounding of the neutral is also to prevent harm to personnel.

If the neutral wire is grounded and one of the phase leads becomes grounded, the excessive current will open a load circuit breaker in order to isolate the fault.  The excessive current will collapse the generator voltage; if the circuit breaker does not trip first. The result depends on the particular generator electrical characteristics; type of fault; and trip of the circuit breaker.  An undervoltage device may be required in order to provide an adequate short circuit protection rating

There are some instances in which it is undesirable to ground the neutral wire. An ungrounded generator neutral lead is acceptable in the applications in which definite measures have been taken in order to prevent grounds to the phase leads. An example of measures are ground fault protective circuits. Ground fault protection requires that the entire group of distribution circuits should be studied and treated as a system.  The owner should engage a certified and registered consultant if a new distribution system is being developed. The owner should also engage a certified and registered consultant if an existing system should be modified for the ground fault protection. such

Neutral resistors and reactors may be added to the system for two reasons: to provide protection during faults and to limit neutral currents.

## Single Units

In a three-phase; four-wire system; the neutral wire should be grounded according to local wiring codes.

In applications; in which definite measures are taken in order to prevent grounds to the load leads, an ungrounded neutral can be used. Be sure to check your local wiring codes.

## Multiple Units

Operation of multiple generators in parallel; having all neutrals grounded, may result in the circulating current through the neutral connections. In order to eliminate the possibility of circulating currents; ground the neutral of only one generator. If multiple generators are alternated on line, a switch should be installed in the neutral ground circuit of each generator. In this case all neutral ground circuits except one can be opened. Be sure that one of the neutral ground circuits is closed.

## Parallel to Utility

When a Wye (Star) connected generator is going to operate in parallel with a utility system (infinite bus) and when the secondary of the step-down transformer in the utility system is also a connection; the following may happen. The grounding of both Wye neutrals may result in circulating currents through the neutrals. Also; the coordination of ground fault protection requires an entire system study: A study should be done by a certified and registered consultant who is familiar with generator systems. The study will determine which grounding method should be used. Wye i01460960

## Voltage Connections

SMCS Code: 4450

## Three-Phase Voltage Connections

The (Star) Configuration for a 480 V generator and the Delta Configuration for a 240 V generator are given in the following diagrams. Wye

The terminals must be connected securely:  The terminals must also be insulated with a good quality electrical tape.

If a Delta Configuration is used; a two-thirds winding pitch is recommended and is required with 590 frame size generators and above. If the generator winding pitch is not two-thirds; third harmonics will cause a high circulating current. The generator will need to be derated. This current can exceed the winding current causing generator overheating and damage which may pose a fire hazard. A Wye (Star) connected generator may require a two-thirds pitch winding if the neutral is solidly grounded. Refer to the Specifications; LEBX6693 , Generator Set Installation Drawings' for more information. A floating neutral does not require a two-thirds pitch winding. rating

## Single-Phase Current From a Three-Phase Generator

Three-phase current and single-phase current can be taken simultaneously from a generator that is connected for three-phase service. In the Wye (Star) Configuration; connect the load to the three-phase leads (any two of the three leads). In the Delta Configuration; connect the load to the three-phase leads (any two of the three leads) . In both configurations; this will provide single-phase voltage at the same voltage as three-phase voltage.

Connect the load to any phase lead and neutral lead of the Wye (Star) Configuration. This will produce voltage at 58% of three-phase voltage.

Refer to Operation Section; Generator Operation" for allowable single-phase loading unbalance.

Single-phase power that is taken from a three-phase source can be a problem.  Ensure that the single-phase loading is equally distributed.

Do not exceed the nameplate current rating for any one phase.

## NOTICE

Never bend the eyebolts and the brackets. Only load the eyebolts and the brackets under tension. Remember that the capacity of an eyebolt is less as the angle between the supporting members and the object becomes less than 90 degrees.

When it is necessary to remove a component at an angle; only use a link bracket that is properly rated for the weight.

Use a hoist to remove heavy components. Use an adjustable lifting beam to lift the engine. AII supporting members (chains and cables) should should be perpendicular to the top of the object that is being lifted.

Some removals require lifting fixtures in order to obtain proper balance. Lifting fixtures also help to provide safety.

To remove the engine ONLY, use the eyes that are on the engine. lifting

Lifting eyes are designed and installed for the specific engine arrangement. Alterations to the eyes andlor the engine make the eyes and the lifting fixtures obsolete: If alterations are made, ensure that proper devices are provided. Consult your Caterpillar dealer for information regarding fixtures for proper engine lifting lifting lifting lifting.

## Engine Lifting with a Generator

## NOTICE

Do notuse the engine lifting eyes to remove the engine and generator together.

## After Starting Engine

SMCS Code: 1000

Note: After the engine has been installed or rebuilt, carefully monitor the engine in order to detect any unusual engine performance.

## Warm-up

- 1 Operate the engine at low idle for two to three minutes. Allow the jacket water coolant temperature to begin to rise before increasing the engine rpm to rated rpm.

Note: More warm-up time may be necessary when the ambient temperature is below -18 'C (0 %).

- 2 Check all of the gauges during the warm-up period.
- 3. Make another walk-around inspection. Inspect the engine for fluid leaks and air leaks.

The time that is needed for the engine to reach the normal mode of operation is usually less than the time that is needed for a walk-around inspection:

The engine will reach normal operating temperature faster when the engine is operated at rated rpm and low power demand. This procedure is more effective than the engine with no load.  The engine should reach normal operating temperature in a few minutes. idling

## Engaging the Generator

- 1. Ensure that the gauges are in the normal ranges for the engine rpm:
- 2 Increase the engine rpm to rated rpm. Always increase the engine speed to rated rpm before applying the load.
- 3. Adjust the voltage and the frequency; if necessary.
- 4 Close the main circuit breaker in order to apply the load.
- 5. Continue to check the gauges and the generator.

## Engine Operation

## Engine Operation

SMCS Code: 1000

Proper operation and maintenance are factors in attaining the maximum service life and economy for the engine: Follow the instructions in this Operation and Maintenance Manual in order to minimize operating costs and maximize the service life of the engine. key

Observe the gauges frequently while the engine is operating: Record the data from the gauges in a regularly. Compare the data to the specifications for normal engine operation: Comparing the data over time will help to detect changes in engine performance. log

Investigate any significant change in the gauge readings: Monitor the engine operation and take action when discrepancies are found.

## Operating the Generator Set

Check the gauges and the generator frequently while the engine is operating under a load. The engine can be operated for extended periods of time at full Ioad.

## Partial Load Operation

Extended operation at low idle or at reduced load may cause increased oil consumption and carbon buildup in the cylinders. Carbon buildup results in a loss of power andlor poor performance.

When possible; apply a full load at least on an hourly basis. This will burn excess carbon from the cylinders.

i01471286

## Fuel Conservation Practices

SMCS Code: 1000; 1250

The efficiency of the engine can affect the fuel economy: Caterpillar's design and technology in manufacturing provides maximum fuel efficiency in all applications:. Follow the recommended procedures in order to attain optimum performance for the life of the engine.

- Avoid spilling fuel.

i01471266

Fuel expands when the fuel is warmed up. The fuel may overflow from the fuel tank. Inspect fuel lines for leaks. Repair the fuel lines; as needed.

- Be aware of the properties of the different fuels. Use only the recommended fuels.
- Avoid unnecessary idling.

Shut off the engine rather than idle for periods of time. long

- Observe the service indicator frequently: the air cleaner elements clean. Keep
- Ensure that the turbochargers are operating correctly so that the proper air/fuel ratio is maintained.  Clean exhaust indicates proper functioning:
- Maintain a good electrical system.

- Ensure that the belts are properly adjusted. The belts should be in good condition.
- Ensure that all of the connections of the hoses are tight. The connections should not leak.
- Ensure that the generator is in good working order.
- Cold engines consume excess fuel:. Utilize heat from the jacket water system and the exhaust system; when possible. cooling system components clean and keep cooling system components in good repair. Never operate the engine without water temperature regulators. All of these items will help maintain operating temperatures. Keep
- Settings for the fuel system and the limits for the operating altitude are stamped on the Engine Information Plate. If an engine is moved to a higher altitude; the settings must be changed by a Caterpillar dealer. Changing the settings will help prevent damage to the turbocharger Changing the settings will help t0 provide the maximum efficiency for the engine: Engines can be operated safely at higher altitudes, but the engines will deliver less horsepower   The fuel settings should be changed by a Caterpillar dealer in order to obtain the rated horsepower.

## Engine Stopping

i01471316

## Cold Weather Operation

i01190421

## Fuel and the Effect from Cold Weather

SMCS Code: 1000; 1250; 1280

The following fuels are the grades that are available for Caterpillar engines:

- No.
- No. 2
- Blend of No. 1 and No. 2

No. 2 diesel fuel is the most commonly used fuel. Either No. 1 diesel fuel or a blend of No. 2 is best suited for cold weather operation:

Quantities of No. 1 diesel fuel are limited. No. diesel fuels are usually available during the months of the winter in the colder climates; During cold weather operation; if No. 1 diesel fuel is not available; use No. 2 diesel fuel, if necessary

There are three major differences between No. 1 and No. 2 diesel fuel. No. 1 diesel fuel has the following properties:

- Lower cloud point
- Lower pour point
- Lower rating of kJ (BTU) per unit volume of fuel

When No. 1 diesel fuel is used, a decrease in power and in fuel efficiency may be noticed. Other operating effects should not be experienced.

The cloud point is the temperature when a cloud of wax crystals begins to form in the fuel.  These crystals can cause the fuel filters to plug: The pour point is the temperature when diesel fuel will thicken. The diesel fuel becomes more resistant to flow through fuel pumps and through fuel lines.

Be aware of these values when diesel fuel is purchased.  Anticipate the average ambient temperature within the area that the engine will be operated.  Engines that are fueled in one climate may not operate well if the engines are moved to another climate. Problems can result due to changes in temperature.

Before troubleshooting for low power or for poor performance in the winter; check the type of fuel that is being used.

When No. 2 diesel fuel is used the following components provide a means of minimizing problems in cold weather:

- Starting aids
- Engine oil pan heaters
- Engine coolant heaters
- Fuel heaters
- Fuel line insulation

For more information on cold weather operation, see Operation and Maintenance Manual, SEBU5898, "Cold Weather Recommendations'

i01250450

## Fuel Related Components in Cold Weather

SMCS Code: 100O; 1250; 1280

## Fuel Tanks

Condensation can form in partially filled fuel tanks. off the fuel tanks after you operate the engine. Top

Fuel tanks should contain some provision for draining water and sediment from the bottom of the tanks. Some fuel tanks use supply pipes that allow water and sediment to settle below the end of the fuel supply pipe.

Some fuel tanks use supply lines that take fuel directly from the bottom of the tank. If the engine is equipped with this system; regular maintenance of the fuel system filter is important.

Drain the water and sediment from any fuel storage tank at the following intervals: weekly; oil changes; and refueling of the fuel tank. This will help prevent water andlor sediment from being pumped from the fuel storage tank and into the engine fuel tank.

## Fuel Filters

It is possible that a primary fuel filter is installed between the fuel tank and the engine fuel inlet. After you change the fuel filter; always prime the fuel system in order to remove air bubbles from the fuel system: Refer to the Operation and Maintenance Manual in the Maintenance Section for more information on priming the fuel system.

The micron rating and the location of a primary fuel filter is important in cold weather operation. The primary fuel filter and the fuel supply line are the most common components that are affected by cold fuel.

## NOTICE

In order to maximize premature wear out from abrasive particles in the fuel, a two micron absolute high efficiency fuel filter is required for all Caterpillar Electronic Unit Injectors. Caterpillar  High Efficiency Fuel Filters meet these requirements. Consult your Caterpillar dealer for the proper part numbers.

## Fuel Heaters

Fuel heaters help to prevent fuel filters from plugging in cold weather due to waxing. A fuel heater should be installed in the fuel system before the primary fuel filter.

The following fuel heaters are recommended for Caterpillar engines:

- 7C-3557 Fuel Heater Group
- 7C-3558 Heater Kit

For further information on fuel heaters; consult your Caterpillar dealer.

Disconnect the fuel heater in warm weather:

Note: Fuel heaters that are controlled by the water temperature regulator or self-regulating fuel heaters should be used with this engine. Fuel heaters that are not controlled by the water temperature regulator can heat the fuel in excess of 659C (149F). A loss of engine power can occur if the fuel supply temperature exceeds 37C (1OOPF) .

Note: Heat exchanger type fuel heaters should have a bypass provision in order to prevent overheating of the fuel in warm weather operation.

## Generator Operation

## Generator Operation

SMCS Code: 4450

## Loading of the Generator

When a generator is installed or reconnected, be sure that the total current in one phase does not exceed the nameplate rating. Each phase should carry the same load. This allows the engine to work at the rated capacity: An electrical unbalance can result in an electrical overload and overheating if one phase current exceeds the nameplate amperage.

Allowable combinations of unbalanced loads are shown in Illustration 54. When you operate with significant single-phase loads; the combinations of single-phase load and three-phase load may be the line on the graph.

i01460891

<!-- image -->

Illustration 54

## Block Loading

When an electrical Ioad is applied to a generator set, block loading occurs. This load may be anywhere from a moderate percentage of the rated load up to the rated load.

The block loading capability of a generator set depends on the following factors.

- engine transient response
- voltage regulator response
- type of the voltage regulator
- altitude of operation of the generator set
- type of load
- the amount of load that is already present

If a block load derating is required; refer to ISO 8268 Standards or SAE J1349 Standards. Also, reference Engine Data Sheet; LEKX4OGG, 'Loading Transient Response' and Engine Data Sheet, "Block and Transient Response'

## Power Factor

The power factor represents the efficiency of the load: The power factor is the ratio of apparent power The power factor represents the portion of the current which is useful work. The portion of current which is not doing useful work is absorbed in maintaining the magnetic field in motors. This current is called the reactive load. Engine power is not required to maintain the reactive load. doing

In most applications; electric motors; solid state controls; and transformers determine the power factor of the system.   Induction motors usually have a power factor that is no larger than 0.8. Incandescent lighting is a resistive load of about 1.0 power factor; or unity. Solid state controls (like motor starters) . .variable frequency drivers (VFD) variable speed drivers (VSD); and UPS systems can operate at any power factor; leading or lagging. In this case; the power factor can be between 0.4 and 1.0.

The power factor of a system may be determined by a power factor meter or by calculations. Determine the power requirement in kW by multiplying the power factor by the kVA that is supplied to the system. As the power factor increases; the total current that is supplied to a constant power demand will decrease. With equal loads, a lower power factor will draw more current. A high power factor will result in full engine load that is less than the generator's rated amperage. A lower power factor increases the possibility of overloading the generator.

Note: Normally; Caterpillar generators are designed for a power factor of 0.8 lagging: Please consult your Caterpillar dealer to check the generator operation at less than 0.7 lagging power factor is desired. rating

## Excitation Systems

## Self-Excited Generators

Self-excited generators receive excitation power and regulator-voltage sensing from the generator's main armature output. The voltage regulator senses the generator output voltage regulated output is provided to the generator exciter . This regulated output is provided by the voltage regulator:  The exciter then provides power to the main rotating field. As the main field rotates; a voltage is induced into the main armature. This voltage is a generator output voltage.

Note: The main armature is also called stator.  The main rotating field is also called rotor

## Permanent Magnet Pilot Excited Generators

Permanent Magnet Pilot Excited (PMPE) generators receive power for the voltage regulator from a pilot exciter; rather than the main armature. The pilot exciter consists of a permanent magnet rotor and a stator.  The pilot exciter operates independently from the generator output voltage. Constant excitation during a large Ioad application is possible because the irregularities that occur in the generator's output voltage are not fed back into the excitation system:  Such irregularities can be caused by load conditions. The independent operation also allows the generator to better sustain an overload for a short duration.

## Low Idle Adjustment

The low idle on 350OB generator sets is typically 900 rpm. On 60 Hz units; low idle will be approximately 66 percent of the full load speed. On 50 Hz units, low idle will be approximately 80 percent of full load speed.

There is no low idle stop on generator sets with electronic governors. On generator sets with mechanical governors and natural gas generator should only be adjusted by your Caterpillar dealer if adjustment is required.

Note: Operating the electric set at low idle speed for an extended time will cause some voltage regulators to shut off: The electric set must be completely shut down. Then; the electric set must be restarted.  This will allow the voltage regulator to again produce an output.

## Standby Generator Sets

Most standby units are automatic. Without an operator in attendance; standby units will perform the following functions: start; pick up the load, run; and stop.

Standby units will not change the governor speed control or voltage level settings automatically:  The governor speed and voltage level must be preset for the proper operation of that unit. Whenever the speed and the voltage level settings are set correctly for automatic operation; Check all switches for the proper setting; The\_Start Selector Switch should be in the AUTOMATIC position: Emergency Stop Switches should be in RUN position:

## Generator Options

## Space Heaters

Most of the SRAB generators are provided with space heaters.  These space heaters are installed for operation in all climates; especially in high humidity conditions. For more information on space heaters, refer to Maintenance Section; "Space Heater Check'

## Embedded Temperature Detectors

SR4B generators are available with embedded temperature detectors. The detectors are installed in the slots of the main armature. The main armature is also called a stator.  The detectors are used with the equipment that is provided by the customer.  Thus, the temperature of the main armature winding can be measured or monitored:. Two types of temperature detectors are available. These types are: RTD and Thermocouple. Contact your Caterpillar dealer for more information.

## Bearing Temperature Detectors

Bearing temperature detectors are available on large-frame generators. Bearing temperature detectors measure the main bearing temperature. Thus, the temperature of the bearing can be measured or monitored. Bearing temperature measurements may help to prevent premature bearing failure. Two types of temperature detectors are available. Bearing temperature detectors are used with customer provided equipment. Contact your Caterpillar dealer for more information:

## Parallel Operation

SMCS Code: 4450

## Initial Start-Up

Preparing a generator for parallel operation requires special attention: Before you attempt to parallel units for the first time, check all the units for the following three conditions.

- same phase rotation
- same alternating current frequency
- same voltage adjustment
- 1. Check the phase rotation.

The phase rotation of the paralleled units must be the same. There are two methods that are used to determine whether the phase rotation of the incoming unit and the phase rotation of the on line unit(s) are the same. These methods are listed below.

- using a phase rotation meter
- using a set of three light bulbs

How to determine the proper phase rotation by using three light bulbs is described below.

Illustration 55

## WARNING

When servicing or repairing electric power generation equipment:

Make sure the unit is off-line (disconnected from utility andlor other generators power service) and either locked out or tagged DO NOT OPERATE. Remove all fuses.

i01479404

- a. Connect the light bulbs with rated voltage between the generator leads and the corresponding line phase. For example connect terminal 1 to line 1 across the open circuit breaker.
- b. Start the units which are going to be paralleled. Bring the units up to speed. As the units approach the same speed, the lights will start to blink.
- If the lights blink in sequence, one of the units is connected backward. In order to correct the problem; stop the units. Remove generator leads 1 and 3 at the circuit breaker. Exchange these generator leads. This reverses the direction of phase rotation. Terminal 2 should always be connected to line 2. Go to 5.
- If lights blink in unison, the phase rotation of both generators is the same. The first condition of "Initial Start-Up" has been met.

## 2. Adjust the frequency.

The speed of the units that will be paralleled must be the same. Speed is proportional to the alternating current frequency

- a. Allow each electric set to run under load for about 30 minutes.
- b. Adjust the governor control to give rated frequency at full load.
- c. Remove the load and check the high idle speed.  The high idle speed should be approximately 2 to 5 percent above full Ioad speed for governors that are equipped with droop. If these speeds can not be obtained, contact your Caterpillar dealer.
- d For the most consistent results; repeat 2b and 2.c until the second condition of Initial Start-Up has been met.

## 3. Adjust the voltage.

There are two fundamentally different methods for reactive power equalization.

- reactive droop compensation (also known as individual compensation)
- cross current compensation (also known as differential compensation)

In the reactive droop compensation the voltage regulator causes an individual generator output voltage to change in proportion to the reactive current. The reactive current is measured with a current transformer (CT). The reactive current can be either lagging or leading: As the lagging reactive current increases; the voltage regulator will cause the generator output voltage to lower (droop) proportionally: As the leading reactive current increases; the voltage regulator will cause the generator output voltage to rise proportionally:   This method will tend to reduce the reactive current for better KVAR sharing with other units. The reactive droop compensation is a standard method on the Caterpillar generator sets The following voltage adjustment procedure is for the reactive droop compensation:

In the cross current compensation the voltage regulator is biased by the difference in reactive current outputs of the paralleled generators. Cross current compensation is very similar to the reactive droop compensation.  The difference is that the secondary circuits of the current transformers are interconnected in a series string. When one of the generators carries more reactive current than other generators or the current that the generator carries is either lagging or leading, a net difference voltage signal will offset the generated voltage.   This will also reduce the reactive current. Refer to the Engine Data Sheet; LEKX8142, "Caterpillar Zero Droop Voltage for Parallel Operation" 'for the adjustment procedure.

Note: The voltage level adjustment and voltage droop adjustment determine the amount of circulating currents between the generators. The circulating currents between the generators will be reduced when the voltage adjustments are carefully matched. Use the same voltmeter to make adjustments on each unit which will be paralleled.

Note: Voltage droop is expressed as the percentage of 0.8 power factor (primarily motors) require a A voltage droop adjustment that causes 3 percent to 8 percent droop in voltage is usually required for satisfactory division of ampere loading:

- a. Adjust the voltage. Refer to the 'Initial Start-Up' in the Operation Section; "Single Unit Operation'
- b. While the engine is running at rated speed, turn the voltage droop potentiometer clockwise about 1/2 of full range.

- If driven load has the unity power factor; set the voltage droop potentiometer on all generators at half of full range. Proceed to 3.9.
- If driven load is to be normal (approximately 0.8 power factor), proceed to 3.c.
- C. Readjust the voltage level rheostat until the voltage is approximately 5 percent above desired voltage.
- d. Apply full load.
- e Readjust the voltage droop rheostat in order to obtain desired voltage with full load at 0.8 power factor. The voltage droop of each generator must be the same in order to satisfactorily divide reactive load.
- f Repeat 3.c, 3.d and 3.e for each generator until the following two conditions are met.
- the line voltage is equal to the desired level at full load
- no load voltage is approximately 5 percent above the rated voltage
- g. Parallel the generators and apply the driven load. Check the output current of the generator.  If the sum of the amperes of the individual generator amperes exceeds the total amperes that are going to the load by 10 percent at full load, adjust voltage droop rheostats . This will lead to proportional current sharing between generators: Some circulating current is permitted at light load. Some circulating current can be expected when generators are cold.

## NOTICE

Damage to the generator is possible. Do NOT exceed the rated ampere load on any single generator.

- h. Make final adjustments after paralleled generators have been running at full load for one hour or more. Tighten the locknuts on all controls. Install the access cover. The last condition of 'Initial Start-Up' has been met.

## Starting Multiple Units

Multiple units are started the same as single units. Refer to Operation Section; "Single Unit Operation"

## Paralleling Multiple Units

Units may be paralleled at no load or paralleled with units under load. After the initial start-up conditions are satisfied; verify for the following requirements.

- One of the governors can be an isochronous governor. Electronic load sharing governors are exception. an
- Generators must have voltage droop compensation or cross current compensation.
- 1 . Start the unit which will be paralleled. Refer to the appropriate engine service manual for start-up procedures.
- 2. Turn the synchronizer lights on.
- 3 After the engine has run a few minutes; bring the engine up to synchronous speed. This means that the frequency of the incoming unit will be the same as the frequency of the unit on line. The synchronizing lights will begin to blink.

Note: The frequency of the incoming unit should be slightly greater than the line frequency  This will allow žhe incoming unit to assume some of the load rather than add to the system load.

- 4. Using the governor control; adjust the engine speed until the lights blink very slowly
- 5. The lights are off when the voltages of the two units are in phase. At this point, very quickly close the breaker while the lights are out.
- 6. Use governor controls in order to share kW Ioad between engines.
- 7. Generator temperature will be stabilized in approximately one hour   After the generator temperature has been stabilized, adjust the voltage droop rheostat of each generator in order to share the reactive Ioad and in order to limit the circulating currents. Less droop increases the reactive current that is carried by the generator. Adjusting the voltage droop rheostat in a counterclockwise direction (CCW) will decrease droop. Adjusting the voltage droop rheostat in a clockwise direction (CW) will increase droop.

## Load Division Speed Droop (If Equipped)

Once two units have been paralleled, the units share of the kW Ioad is determined by the governor control setting: If two units of the same capacity and the same governor characteristics have the same governor control settings; the units will share capacity of the one engine.

In order to transfer the load from one engine to another; follow the following procedure

- 1. Increase the governor speed control of one unit in order to increase the load.
- 2 Reduce the governor speed control of the other unit in order to decrease the load on that unit.
- 3. Raise or lower the governor speed control of both units to change system frequency:

The module provides proportional load sharing: More information is available in the System Operation; Testing and Adjusting, SENR6565 , 'Generator Set Load Sensor and Generator Load Sharing Module"

## Function of The Engine Governor

This section describes the function of the engine governor in relation to load division between parallel electric sets. For detailed information on governor controls and adjustments; see the Operation &amp; Maintenance Manual and the Service Manual for the appropriate engine.

It is very important to understand two basic facts about load division between generator sets which are operating in parallel.

- 1. The power which is supplied to the generator and, thus, to the load is a function of the engine. The engine governor settings and the positions of the governor controls determine the amount of power that is delivered by the engine. Therefore, the engine governor settings and the positions of the governor controls determine the kW load which is carried by the generator. If the governor control setting is advanced; the engine and generator will assume more kW load. Likewise decreasing the governor control setting will result in a reduction of load on the unit. other units on the line will, conversely; either reduce load or load at the same time. These other units will assume that no change in total Ioad or no change in the governor settings of the other units has taken place. Any gain
- 2. The division of power is not determined by generator excitation or terminal voltage. The power factor at which a generator will operate when paralleled with other generators is determined by the excitation.

Governors that are used with Caterpillar powered electric sets can be of two types: governors with fixed speed droop or governors with adjustable speed droop. The values of speed droop which are commonly used are 3 percent and 0 percent. Governors with adjustable speed droop can be adjusted so their characteristics match quite closely the characteristics of governors with fixed speed droop. If the governor is adjusted for 0 percent speed droop (isochronous) operation; then the same speed from no load to full load can be obtained.

## Summary on Governor Operation

The preceding discussion of governor operation can be summarized below.

- The simplest governor combination for parallel electric sets is to have approximately 3 percent speed droop characteristics for each governor. If a constant frequency from no load to full load is required, one governor can be adjusted for isochronous operation:  This isochronous unit will be called a "lead unit" .
- In order for all paralleled units to accept their full share of the load; the following governor adjustments are required. The governors should have the same full load speed. The governors should have the same high idle (no load) speed in the case of governors which are adjusted for speed droop operation. Governor controls should be set to the high idle position so that the full governor range is available.
- Operation of an isochronous governor in parallel with speed droop governors requires special techniques.
- number of electric sets can be operated in parallel. However; only one governor of the group can be adjusted for isochronous operation:  The exception will be some special cases of electronic governors with automatic Ioad sharing: Any

## Stopping

In order to remove a generator from the line; perform the following procedure.

- 1. Check the load. The Ioad must be less than the rated capacity of the remaining units.
- 2 Be sure that the neutral of one of the remaining units is grounded.
- 3. Remove the load from the outgoing unit. See the Parallel Operation; "Load Division Speed Droop' The amperage may never go to zero due to circulating currents.
- 4 Open the circuit breaker.
- 5 Allow the engine to cool for five minutes.
- 6. Stop the engine.

## Circulating Currents

Understanding the circulating currents becomes very important when you parallel the units. These circulating currents are flowing between paralleled generators: The circulating currents are caused by voltage differences between the generators and are not useful work. The amount of the circulating current can be determined by subtracting the amperage which is going to the load from the total generator amperage. doing

The circulating current may be as high as 25 percent of rated amperes with cold generator sets. Such current may not even be considered harmful. The total generator current should not exceed the amperage rating:

As the generators warm; the circulating currents will decrease. The ammeter readings should decrease slightly; but the voltage meter readings should remain constant.

The electronic modular control panel Il+ (EMCP Il+) is located above the generator distribution housing:  The control panel consists of a main panel with indicators, meters and control switches. This control panel may be equipped with optional modules in order to match the customers' needs and requirements.

Generator Set Control + (1) The generator set control (GSC+) is the main component of the EMCP Il+ See the topic "Generator Set Control (GSC+)" in this section.

The left side of the control panel contains the Generator Set Control + (GSC+). This is the main component of the system. The GSC+ displays the following information: generator output; fault conditions; and engine parameters . The center section of the control panel contains switches and an optional alarm module. The right side of the control panel may be blank, or the right side of the control panel may contain the Synchronizing Lights Module or the Custom Alarm Module. key

The main control panel may or may not contain all of the components which are shown in Illustration 59 or Illustration 60. Some components are optional. The optional components may not be required for your particular application:

Start Aid Switch (2) The start aid switch (SAS) is optional. The SAS is used to inject ether into the engine when you are starting the engine in cold weather conditions. When the SAS is in the ON position; the switch energizes the starting aid solenoid valve (SASV) and meters a specific amount of ether into a holding chamber: When the SAS is released, the solenoid releases the ether to the engine.

## NOTICE

The engine must be cranking before using the start aid switch. Damage to the engine is possible if ether is released to the engine but not exhausted or burned by the engine when cranking:

Illustration 61

900777781

The location of the GSC+ on the EMCP Il+ control panel

The left side of the control panel contains the generator set control (GSC+). The GSC+ is the main component of the system. The GSC+ displays the following information: generator output, generator set functions; fault conditions; and engine parameters. The GSC+ accepts information Tfrom the following sources: operator; speed sensor; engine oil pressure sensor; water temperature sensor; and optional remote sourcesThis information is used to determine the "onloff" state of the engine's air; fuel, and starter. key\_

In the very basic operating conditions; the GSC+ receives a signal to run the generator set. The GSC+ turns on the engine's fuel and starter.  When the engine speed reaches the crank termination speed, the starter is disengaged. When the GSC+ receives a signal to stop the engine; the GSC+ shuts the fuel off.

The functions of the GSC+ are listed below.

- The GSC+ controls the normal starting and stopping of the engine.

- The GSC+ shows engine conditions and generator output information on two displays. The displays also show fault codes and GSC+ programming information.
- The GSC+ monitors the system for faults. If a fault occurs, the GSC+ performs a controlled fault shutdown or the GSC+ provides a fault alarm annunciation. The GSC+ uses indicators and displays in order to describe the fault.
- The GSC+ contains programmable features for certain applications or customer requirements.

The features of the GSC+ are listed below:

- Cycle Crank: The GSC+ can be programmed to crank for adjustable time periods.
- Governor Control: When the engine oil pressure increases past the low oil pressure setpoint, the GSC+ will indicate to the governor that the governor should increase the engine speed from idle rpm to rated RPM.
- Cooldown: Upon receiving a signal to perform a normal shutdown; the GSC+ will wait a preprogrammed amount of time before shutting the engine down by means of the fuel control.
- Automatic Operation: While in the automatic mode; the GSC+ can be started by a remote initiate signal (contact closure). Upon loss of the signal (contact opening), the GSC+ will perform a normal shutdown.
- Alarm Module Communication: The GSC+ can transmit fault and alarm conditions to an alarm module (AM)
- Power Down: The EMCP Il+ system is designed to remove power from the GSC+ when the engine control switch (ECS) is in the OFFIRESET mode and when the proper jumper wire is removed. The GSC+ will not allow the power down until the crank termination relay and the fuel control relay are both off for about 70 seconds. If the wire is not removed; the GSC+ will remain powered up.
- Fuel Solenoid Type: The GSC+ can be programmed to work with either an energized to run (ETR) fuel system or an energized to shutdown (ETS) fuel system:

The ten fault indicators are used in order to show and t0 describe a fault that is present.  The fault indicators are divided into four groups. The four groups are:

- Fault alarm indicator (22)
- Fault shutdown indicator (21)
- fault Spare indicators (24)
- Dedicated shutdown indicators (23)

The yellow fault alarm indicator (22) FLASHES when the GSC+ detects an alarm fault. The alarm fault does not cause the engine status to change.  The engine can be started. The engine will continue operating only if the engine is running at the time of the alarm fault. Fault alarm indicator (22) is accompanied by an alarm fault code that is shown on the upper display (25) when the alarm codes (26) is pressed. key

The red fault shutdown indicator (21) FLASHES when the GSC+ detects a shutdown fault. The engine will be shut down if the engine is running: The engine will not be allowed to start. Fault shutdown indicator (21) is accompanied by a fault code that is immediately shown on the upper display (25).

The yellow spare fault indicators (24) FLASH when the conditions that are associated with that spare fault are active. The three spare faults can be programmed to show coolant loss; engine oil temperature; spare fault condition or no assignment. The spare fault condition may be a customer generated switch input. The yellow fault alarm indicator (22) or the red fault shutdown indicator (21) will accompany the spare fault indicators (24). The spare fault indicators will tell whether the spare fault input is programmed to be an alarm condition or a shutdown condition.

The red dedicated shutdown indicators (23) represent the following shutdown faults: low engine oil pressure; emergency stop; high water temperature, engine overspeed, and engine overcrank. When the GSC+ detects a fault in one of these areas; the dedicated shutdown indicator (that corresponds to the fault) FLASHES. The engine is shutdown if the engine is running; and the engine is not allowed to start. No fault codes are associated with the dedicated shutdown indicators because each indicator has a descriptive label.

Many of the dedicated shutdown faults depend on certain setpoints in the GSC+.

The conditions that are required to activate the dedicated fault shutdowns and the results of each dedicated fault are in the following list.

Low Oil Pressure The engine oil pressure drops below the setpoints for low oil pressure shutdown that are programmed into the GSC+. There are two low oil pressure setpoints. One setpoint is used when the engine is at idle speed.  The other setpoint is used when the engine is at rated speed. When a low oil pressure fault occurs, the low oil pressure indicator FLASHES; and the engine is shut down. The engine is not allowed to start until the fault is corrected.

Emergency Stop The operator presses the emergency stop push button (ESPB) on the front panel.  When an emergency stop condition occurs; the emergency stop indicator FLASHES and the engine is shut down: The engine is not allowed to start until the condition is corrected.

High Water Temperature The engine coolant temperature rises above the setpoint for high water temperature shutdown that is programmed into the GSC+ When the high water temperature fault occurs, the high water temperature indicator FLASHES. The engine is shutdown and the engine is not allowed to start until the fault is corrected.

Engine Overspeed The engine speed exceeds the setpoint for engine overspeed that is programmed into the GSC+ When the engine overspeed fault occurs, the engine overspeed indicator FLASHES. The engine is shutdown and the engine is not allowed to start until the fault is corrected.

Overcrank The engine does not start within the setpoint for total cycle crank time that is programmed into the GSC+: When the overcrank fault occurs;, the overcrank indicator FLASHES. The engine is not allowed to start until the fault is corrected.

Note: The GSC+ can be programmed to override the shutdown for oil pressure and high water temperature faults. When the operator overrides the shutdown faults, the GSC+ responds to the faults as though the faults are alarm faults. The corresponding dedicated shutdown indicator is ON continuously and will not be flashing. The engine continues to run and can be restarted when necessary. When the dedicated shutdown indicator is ON continuously; the setpoint for shutdown has been exceeded, but the GSC+ is programmed to override the shutdown fault. The GSC+ does not treat the shutdown fault as a shutdown fault. The GSC+ treats the shutdown fault as an alarm fault. At the factory; the GSC+ is programmed to treat a low oil pressure fault and a high water temperature fault as shutdown faults. The operator or the service technician must decide to override these shutdown faults . The operator or the service technician must program the GSC+ to treat the shutdown faults as alarm faults.

- 2. Seal the unit in a covering of plastic or other material that has been designed for that purpose.
- that preservative greases and desiccant bags are removed before the unit is placed in operation:

## Bearing Inspection

Ball bearing generators use grease. This grease is longer than one year; new ball bearings should be installed.  These bearings should be greased to the proper level to put into operation: If inspection indicates that bearings are free of rust or corrosion, and no noise or excessive vibration appear on start-up; replacement is not necessary prior being

## Location

The location of the generator must comply with all local regulations.  The location of the generator must also comply with all special industrial regulations. Locate the generator in an area that meets the following requirements:

- clean

- dry
- well ventilated
- easily accessible for inspection and maintenance

Do not obstruct air inlet openings. Do not obstruct discharge openings. Coolant flow must reach these openings. If the generator is exposed to harsh environmental conditions, the generator can be modified in the field in order to add filters and space heaters. In addition; a more rigid periodic maintenance schedule should be established.

## Electrical Measurements

Measure the insulation resistance of each winding if the generator was exposed to the following conditions:

- rapid changes in temperature
- freezing
- wet climate during shipment
- wet climate during storage

Note: These tests should be conducted prior to any power connections that are made. These tests should be conducted prior to any control connections that are being made. being

## Engine Oil

SMCS Code: 1300; 1348; 7581

## Caterpillar Diesel Engine Oil

Caterpillar Oils have been developed and tested in order to provide the full performance and service life that has been designed and built into Caterpillar Engines. Caterpillar Oils are currently used to fill diesel engines at the factory: These oils are offered by Caterpillar dealers for continued use when the engine oil is changed. Consult your Caterpillar dealer for more information on these oils.

Due to significant variations in the quality and in the performance of commercially available oils; Caterpillar makes the following recommendations:

- Caterpillar Diesel Engine Oil (10W30)

## Caterpillar Diesel Engine Oil (15W40)

Caterpillar multigrade Diesel Engine Oil is formulated with the correct amounts of detergents; dispersants; and alkalinity in order to provide superior performance in Caterpillar Diesel Engines.

Caterpillar multigrade Diesel Engine Oil is available in two viscosity grades (1OW3O and 15W40): For direct injection engines; see Table 11 in order to choose the correct viscosity grade for the ambient temperature. Multigrade oils provide the correct viscosity for a broad range of operating temperatures.

Multigrade oils are effective in maintaining low oil consumption and low levels of piston deposits.

Caterpillar multigrade Diesel Engine Oil can be used in other diesel engines and in gasoline engines. See the engine manufacturer's guide for the recommended specifications. Compare the specifications to the specifications of Caterpillar multigrade Diesel Engine Oil.  The current industry standards for Caterpillar Diesel Engine Oil are listed on the product label and on the data sheets for the product.

Consult your Caterpillar dealer for part numbers and for available sizes of containers.

## Commercial Oils

The performance of commercial diesel engine oils is based on American Petroleum Institute (API) classifications. These API classifications are developed in order to provide commercial lubricants for a broad range of diesel engines that operate at various conditions.

If Caterpillar multigrade Diesel Engine Oil is not used, only use commercial oils that meet the following classifications:

- EMA LRG-1 multigrade oil (preferred oil)
- API CH-4 multigrade oil (preferred oil)
- API CG-4 multigrade oil (preferred oil)
- API CF-4 multigrade oil (acceptable oil)

In order to make the proper choice of a commercial oil, refer to the following explanations:

EMA LRG-1 The Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) has developed lubricant recommendations as an alternative to the API oil classification system. LRG-1 is a Recommended Guideline that defines a level of oil performance for these types of diesel engines: high speed; four oils may be used in Caterpillar engines when the following oils are recommended: API CH-4, API CG-4, and API CF-4. LRG-1 oils are intended to provide superior performance in comparison to API CG-4 and API CF-4.

LRG-1 oils will meet the needs of high performance Caterpillar diesel engines that are operating in many applications. The tests and the test limits that are used to define LRG-1 are similar to the new API CH-4 classification.   Therefore; these oils will also meet the requirements of the low emissions diesel engines. LRG-1 oils are designed to control the harmful effects of soot with improved wear resistance and improved resistance to plugging of the oil filter.  These oils will also provide superior piston deposit control for engines with either two-piece steel pistons or aluminum pistons.

All LRG-1 oils must complete a full test program with the base stock and with the viscosity grade of API Base Oil Interchange Guidelines' are not appropriate for LRG-1 oils. This feature reduces the variation in performance that can occur when base stocks are changed in commercial oil formulations.

LRG-1 oils are recommended for use in extended oil change interval programs that optimize oil life. These oil change interval programs are based on oil analysis. LRG-1 oils are recommended for conditions that demand a premium oil.  Your Caterpillar dealer has the specific guidelines for optimizing oil change intervals.

API CH-4 API CH-4 oils were developed in order to meet the requirements of the new high performance diesel engines.  Also; the oil was designed to meet the requirements of the low emissions diesel engines: API CH-4 oils are also acceptable for use in older diesel engines and in diesel engines that use high sulfur diesel fuel. API CH-4 oils may be used in Caterpillar engines that generally exceed the performance of API CG-4 oils in the following criteria: deposits on pistons; control of oil consumption; wear of piston rings; valve train wear; viscosity control, and corrosion.

Three new engine tests were developed for the API CH-4 oil.  The first test specifically evaluates deposits on pistons for engines with the two-piece steel piston. This test (piston deposit) also measures the control of oil consumption. A second test is conducted with moderate oil soot. The second test measures the following criteria: wear of piston rings, wear of cylinder liners; and resistance to corrosion. A third new test measures the following characteristics with high levels of soot in the oil: wear of the valve train; resistance of the oil in plugging the oil filter; and control of sludge.

In addition to the new tests; API CH-4 oils have tougher limits for viscosity control in applications that generate high soot:.  The oils also have improved oxidation resistance. API CH-4 oils must pass an additional test (piston deposit) for engines that use aluminum pistons (single piece). Oil performance is also established for engines that operate in areas with high sulfur diesel fuel.

All of these improvements allow the API CH-4 oil to achieve optimum oil change intervals. API CH-4 oils are recommended for use in extended oil change intervals. API CH-4 oils are recommended for conditions that demand a premium oil. Your Caterpillar dealer has specific guidelines for optimizing oil change intervals.

API CG-4 API CG-4 oils were developed primarily for diesel engines that use a 0.05 percent level of fuel sulfur. However; API CG-4 oils can be used with higher sulfur fuels. The TBN of the new oil determines the maximum fuel sulfur level for API CG-4 and API CF-4 oils. See Illustration 75.

API CG-4 oils are the first oils that are required to pass industry standard tests for foam control and viscosity shear loss. API CG-4 oils must also pass tests that were developed for corrosion, wear and oxidation.

API CF-4 These oils service a wide variety of modern diesel engines. API CF-4 oils provide more stable oil control and reduced piston deposits in comparison to API CF and the obsolete CE and CD classifications of oil. API CF-4 oils provide improved soot dispersancy in comparison to API CF and obsolete CD oils. The API CF-4 classification was developed with a 0.40 percent sulfur diesel fuel. This represents the type of diesel fuels that are commonly available worldwide

Note: Do not use\_single grade API CF oils or multigrade API CF oils in Caterpillar Direct Injection (DI) Commercial Diesel Engines.

Some commercial oils that meet the API classifications may require reduced oil change intervals. To determine the oil change interval, closely monitor the condition of the oil and perform a program is the preferred method.

## NOTICE

Failure to follow these oil recommendations can cause shortened engine service life due to deposits andlor excessive wear.

## Total Base Number (TBN) and Fuel Sulfur Levels for Direct Injection (DI) Diesel Engines

The Total Base Number (TBN) for an oil depends on the fuel sulfur level: For direct injection engines that use distillate fuel, the minimum TBN of the new oil must be 10 times the fuel sulfur level. The TBN is defined by ASTM D2896"\_ The minimum TBN of the oil is 5 regardless of fuel sulfur level. Illustration 75 demonstrates the TBN.

Illustration 75

<!-- image -->

- TBN by "ASTM D2896"
- TBN of new oil
- Percentage of fuel sulfur by weight
- Change the oil when the TBN deteriorates to 50 percent of the original TBN.

Use the following guidelines for fuel sulfur levels that exceed 1.5 percent:

- Choose an oil with the highest TBN that meets one of these classifications: EMA LRG-1, API CH-4, API CG-4, and API CF-4.
- Reduce the oil change interval. Base the oil change interval on the oil analysis. Ensure that the oil analysis includes the condition of the oil and a wear metal analysis.

Excessive piston deposits can be produced by an oil with a high TBN. These deposits can lead to a loss of control of the oil consumption and to the polishing of the cylinder bore.

## NOTICE

Operating Direct Injection (DI) diesel engines with fuel sulfur levels over 1.0 percent may require shortened oil change intervals in order to help maintain adequate wear protection.

## Lubricant Viscosity Recommendations for Direct Injection (Dl) Diesel Engines

The proper SAE viscosity grade of oil is determined by the minimum ambient temperature during cold engine start-up; and the maximum ambient temperature during engine operation:

Refer to Table 11 (minimum temperature) in order to determine the required oil viscosity for starting a cold engine.

Refer to Table 11 (maximum temperature) in order to select the oil viscosity for engine operation at the highest ambient temperature that is anticipated.

Generally; use the highest oil viscosity that is available to meet the requirement for the temperature at start-up.

Table 11

| Engine Oil Viscosity                                                | Engine Oil Viscosity   | Engine Oil Viscosity   |

## Re-refined Base Stock Oils

SMCS Code: 1348; 7581

Re-refined base stock oils are acceptable for use in Caterpillar engines if these oils meet the performance requirements that are specified by Caterpillar. Re-refined base stock oils can be used exclusively in finished oil or in a combination with new base stock oils. The US military specifications and the specifications of other heavy equipment manufacturers also allow the use of re-refined base stock oils that meet the same criteria:

The process that is used to make re-refined base stock oil should adequately remove all wear metals that are in the used oil and all additives that are in the used oil.  The process that is used to make re-refined base stock oil generally involves the processes of vacuum distillation and hydrotreating the used oil. Filtering is inadequate for the production of high quality re-refined base stock oils from used oil.

i01111406

## Synthetic Base Stock Oils

SMCS Code: 1348; 7581

Synthetic base oils are acceptable for use in Caterpillar engines if these oils meet the performance requirements that are specified for the engine compartment.

Synthetic base oils generally perform better than conventional oils in the following two areas:

- Synthetic base oils have improved flow at low temperatures especially in arctic conditions.
- Synthetic base oils have improved oxidation stability especially at high operating temperatures.

Some synthetic base oils have performance characteristics that enhance the service life of the oil. However, Caterpillar does not recommend the automatic extension of oil change intervals for any type of oil. Oil change intervals for Caterpillar engines can only be adjusted after an oil analysis program that contains the following tests: oil condition and wear metal analysis (Caterpillar's S-0.S oil analysis) trend analysis; fuel consumption; and oil consumption.

## Cold Weather Lubricants

SMCS Code: 1348; 7581

When an engine is started and operated in ambient F), use multigrade oils that are capable of flowing in low temperatures.

These oils have viscosity grades of SAE OW or of SAE 5W.

When an engine is started and operated in ambient temperatures below -30 'C (-22 'F), use a synthetic base stock multigrade oil with a OW viscosity grade or with a 5W viscosity grade: Use an oil with a pour point that is lower than -50 'C (-58 'F).

The number of acceptable lubricants is limited in cold weather conditions. Caterpillar recommends the following lubricants for use in cold weather conditions:

- First choice: API CG-4 or API CF-4 oils with a SAE OW2O, OW3O, 5W30, or 5W40 viscosity grade.
- Second Choice: If the First Choice oils are not available; the following viscosity grades of oils with a CG-4 or CF-4 additive package can be SAE 5W30, and SAE 5W40. However; use of these oils is not recommended.

## NOTICE

Shortened engine service life could result if second choice oils are used.

i01123104

## Aftermarket Oil Additives

SMCS Code: 1348; 7581

Caterpillar does not recommend the use of aftermarket additives in oil. It is not necessary to use aftermarket additives in order to achieve the engine's maximum service life or rated performance: Fully formulated; finished oils consist of base oils and of commercial additive packages. These additive packages are blended into the base oils at precise percentages in order to help provide finished oils with performance characteristics that meet industry standards.

i01261688

There are no industry standard tests that evaluate the performance or the compatibility of aftermarket additives in finished oil. Aftermarket additives may not be compatible with the finished oil's additive package; which could lower the performance of the finished oil. The aftermarket additive could fail to mix with the finished oil. This could produce sludge in the crankcase: Caterpillar discourages the use of aftermarket additives in finished oils.

To achieve the best performance from a Caterpillar engine; conform to the following guidelines:

- Select the proper Caterpillar oil or a commercial oil that meets the EMA Recommended Guideline on Diesel Engine Oil" or the recommended API classification.
- See the appropriate Lubricant Viscosities" table in order to find the correct oil viscosity grade for your engine
- At the specified interval, service the engine new oil filter.
- Perform maintenance at the intervals that are specified in the Operation and Maintenance Manual , 'Maintenance Interval Schedule'

## S.0.S Oil Analysis

SMCS Code: 1348; 7542-008

Caterpillar recommends the use of the S-O-S oil analysis program in order to monitor the condition and the maintenance requirements of the equipment.  The S-O.S oil analysis program will complement the preventive maintenance program.

The S-O-S oil analysis is a diagnostic tool that is used to determine oil performance and component wear rates. Contamination can be identified and measured through the use of the S-O.S oil analysis. The S-O-S oil analysis includes the following tests:

- The Wear Rate Analysis monitors the wear of the engine's metals. The amount of wear metal and type of wear metal that is in the oil is analyzed. The increase in the rate of engine wear metal in the oil is as important as the quantity of engine wear metal in the oil. For this reason; regular sampling at specified intervals is necessary in order to establish wear rates. Intermittent sampling does not allow wear rate trend lines to be established. Engine wear metals in the oil sample are compared to established Caterpillar norms in order to determine acceptability.
- Tests are conducted in order to detect contamination of the oil by water; glycol or fuel.
- The Oil Condition Analysis determines the loss of the oil's lubricating properties. An infrared analysis is used to compare the properties of new oil to the properties of the used oil sample. This analysis allows technicians to determine the amount of deterioration of the oil during use. This analysis also allows technicians to verify the performance of the oil according to the

The test results of the oil samples will then be used as a basis for determining the oil change interval for the engine. The results of the S-O-.S oil analysis changes without the risk of engine damage.

## Fuel Specifications

## Fuel Recommendations

SMCS Code: 1280

variety of fuels. These fuels are divided into two general groups. The two groups are called the preferred fuels and the permissible fuels.

The preferred fuels provide maximum engine service life and performance. The preferred fuels are distillate fuels. These fuels are commonly called diesel fuel, furnace fuel, gas oil, or kerosene.

The permissible fuels are crude oils or blended fuels Use of these fuels can result in higher maintenance costs and in reduced engine service life.

Diesel fuels that meet the specifications in Table 13 will help to provide maximum engine service life and performance. In North America, diesel fuel that is identified as No. 1-D or No. 2-D in ASTM D975" generally meet the specifications. Table 13 is for diesel fuels that are distilled from crude oil. Diesel fuels from other sources could exhibit detrimental properties that are not defined or controlled by this specification.

- Caterpillar fuel systems and engine components can operate on high sulfur fuels. Fuel sulfur levels affect exhaust emissions. High sulfur fuels also increase the potential for corrosion of internal components. Fuel sulfur levels above 1.0 percent significantly shorten the oil change interval: For additional information, see this publication; 'Engine Oil" topic (Maintenance Section) may
- (2) The values of the fuel viscosity are the values as the fuel is delivered to the fuel injection pumps. If a fuel with a low viscosity is used, cooling of the fuel may be required to maintain a 1.4 cSt viscosity at the fuel injection pump: Fuels with a high viscosity might require fuel heaters in order to bring down the viscosity to a 20 cSt viscosity: For additional information; see Special Publication; SEBDO717, "Diesel Fuel and Your Engine" .
- (4) The lubricity of a fuel is a concern with low sulfur fuel: To determine the lubricity of the fuel, use either the "ASTM D6078 Scuffing Load Wear Test (SBOCLE)" or the "ASTM D6079 High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFRR)" test. If the lubricity of a fuel does not meet the minimum requirements; consult your fuel supplier. Do not treat the fuel without consulting the fuel supplier. Some additives are not compatible. These additives can cause problems in the fuel system.
- (3) Follow the test conditions and procedures for gasoline (motor) .

## NOTICE

Operating with fuels that do not meet Caterpillar's recommendations can cause the following effects: startdifficulty; poor combustion; deposits in the fuel injectors;  reduced service life of the fuel system, deposits in the combustion chamber, and reduced service life of the engine. ing

In the USA, 0.05 percent diesel fuels have been used in all on-highway truck engines since 1 January 1994. This low sulfur diesel fuel was mandated as a means of directly reducing particulate emissions from diesel truck engines; This low sulfur fuel will also be used in Caterpillar commercial diesel engines when low emissions are required or when the fuel supply sources provide this type of fuel. Caterpillar has not seen any detrimental effects with 0.05 percent sulfur fuel in Caterpillar diesel engines.

## NOTICE

Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), Residual fuel, or Blended fuel must NOT be used in Caterpillar diesel engines (except in 3600 Series HFO engines) . Severe component wear and component failures will result if HFO type fuels are used in engines that are configured to use distillate fuel.

In extreme cold ambient conditions, you may use the distillate fuels that are specified in Table 14. However, the fuel that is-selected must meet the requirements that are specified in Table 13. These fuels are intended to be used in operating temperatures that are down to -54 %C (-65 ').

Table 14

| Distillate Fuels   | Distillate Fuels   |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Specification      | Grade              |

| "MIL-T-83133D"     | JP-8               |

- The fuels that are listed in this Table may not meet the requirements that are specified in the "Caterpillar Specifications for Distillate Diesel Fuel" . Table; Consult the supplier for the recommended additives in order to maintain the proper fuel lubricity:

These fuels are lighter than the No. 2 grades of fuel. The cetane number of the fuels in Table 14 must be at least 40. If the viscosity is below 1.4 cSt at 38  C (100 'C (32 'F). Do not use any fuels with a viscosity of less than 1.2 cSt at 38 'C (100 %). Fuel cooling may be required in order to maintain the minimum viscosity of 1.4 cSt at the fuel injection pump. PF)

There are many other diesel fuel specifications that are published by governments and by technological societies:  Usually; those specifications do not review all the requirements that are addressed in this specification. To ensure optimum engine performance; a complete fuel analysis should be obtained before engine operation. The fuel analysis should include all of the properties that are listed in Table 13.

## Cooling System Specifications

i01261719

## General Coolant Information

SMCS Code: 1350;1395

## NOTICE

Never add coolant to an overheated engine. Engine damage could result. Allow the engine to cool first.

## NOTICE

If the engine is to be stored in, or shipped to an area with below freezing temperatures; the cooling system must be either protected to the lowest outside temperature or drained completely to prevent damage.

## NOTICE

In cold weather; frequently check the specific gravity of the coolant solution to ensure adequate protection.

Clean the cooling system for the following reasons:

- Contamination of the cooling system
- Overheating of the engine
- Foaming of the coolant

Note: Air pockets can form in the cooling system if the cooling system is filled at a rate that is greater than 20 L (5 US gal) per minute.

After you drain the cooling system and after you refill the cooling system; operate the engine: Operate the engine without the filler cap until the coolant reaches normal operating temperature and the coolant level stabilizes. Ensure that the coolant is maintained to the proper level.

## NOTICE

Never operate an engine without water temperature regulators in the cooling system: Water temperature regulators help to maintain the engine coolant at the proper operating temperature.  Cooling system problems can develop without water temperature regulators.

'Know Your Cooling System' and Special Instruction; SEBDO97O "Coolant and Your Engine' for more detailed information.

Many engine failures are related to the cooling system. The following problems are related to cooling system failures: overheating; leakage of the water pump; plugged radiators or heat exchangers; and pitting of the cylinder liners.

These failures can be avoided with proper cooling system maintenance. Cooling system maintenance is as important as maintenance of the fuel system and the lubrication system. Quality of the coolant is important as the quality of the fuel and the lubricating oil. as

Coolant is normally composed of three elements: water; additives; and glycol.

## Water

## NOTICE

All Caterpillar diesel engines equipped with air-to-air aftercooling (ATAAC) require a minimum of 30 percent glycol to prevent water pump cavitation.

## NOTICE

Never use water alone without Supplemental Coolant Additives (SCA) or without inhibited coolant.   Water alone is corrosive at engine operating temperatures. Water alone does not provide adequate protection against boiling or freezing:

Water is used in the cooling system in order to transfer heat.

## Distilled water or deionized water is recommended for use in engine cooling systems.

DO NOT use the following types of water in cooling systems: hard water, softened water that has been conditioned with salt, and sea water.

If distilled water or deionized water is not available use water with the properties that are listed in Table 15.

## Additives

Additives help to protect the metal surfaces of the cooling system. A lack of coolant additives or insufficient amounts of additives enable the following conditions to occur;

- Corrosion
- Formation of mineral deposits
- Rust
- Scale
- and erosion from cavitation of the cylinder liner Pitting
- Foaming of the coolant

Many additives are depleted during engine operation. These additives must be replaced periodically:  This can be done by adding Supplemental Coolant Additives (SCA) to Diesel Engine AntifreezelCoolant (DEAC) or by adding ELC Extender to Extended Life Coolant (ELC) .

Additives must be added at the proper concentration. Overconcentration of additives can cause the inhibitors to drop out-of-solution The deposits can enable the following problems to occur:

- Formation of gel compounds
- Reduction of heat transfer
- Leakage of the water pump seal
- Plugging of radiators; coolers; and small passages

## Glycol

Glycol in the coolant helps to provide protection against the following conditions:

- Boiling
- Freezing
- Cavitation of the water pump and the cylinder liner

For optimum performance; Caterpillar recommends a 1:1 mixture of a waterlglycol solution.

## NOTICE

All Caterpillar diesel engines equipped with air-to-air aftercooling (ATAAC) require a minimum of 30 percent glycol to prevent water pump cavitation.

Note: Use a mixture that will provide protection against the lowest ambient temperature.

Note: 100 percent pure glycol will freeze at a

Most conventional heavy-duty coolantlantifreezes use ethylene glycol. Propylene glycol may also be used.  In a 1:1 mixture with water; ethylene and propylene glycol provide similar protection against freezing and boiling. See Tables 16 and 17.

## Table 16

| Ethylene Glycol   | Ethylene Glycol   | Ethylene Glycol   |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Concentration     | Freeze Protection | Boil Protection   |
| 50 Percent        |                   |                   |
| 60 Percent        |                   | 'F                |

## NOTICE

Do not use propylene glycol in concentrations that exceed 50 percent glycol because of propylene glycol's reduced heat transfer capability.  Use ethylene glycol in conditions that require additional protection against boiling or freezing.

Table 17

| Propylene Glycol   | Propylene Glycol   | Propylene Glycol   |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Concentration      | Freeze Protection  | Boil Protection    |
| 50 Percent         | ~29 'C (-20 'F)    | 106 'C (223 'F)    |

To check the concentration of glycol, use the 1U-7298 CoolantBattery Tester (Degree Celsius) or use the 1U-7297 CoolantlBattery Tester (Degree Fahrenheit). The testers give readings that are immediate and accurate. The testers can be used with ethylene or propylene glycol.

## Coolant Recommendations

SMCS Code: 1350; 1352; 1395

NOTICE Do not use a commercial coolantlantifreeze that only meets the ASTM D3306 or D4656 specification:  This type of coolantlantifreeze is made for light automotive applications. duty

The following coolants are the primary types of coolants that are used in Caterpillar Engines:

Preferred Caterpillar Extended Life Coolant (ELC) or a commercial extended life coolant that meets the Caterpillar EC-1 specification

Acceptable Caterpillar  Diesel Engine AntifreezelCoolant (DEAC) or a commercial heavy-duty coolantlantifreeze that meets ASTM D4985" or ASTM D5345" specifications

Caterpillar recommends a 1:1 mixture of water and glycol.  This mixture will provide optimum heavy-duty performance as a coolantlantifreeze.

Note: Caterpillar DEAC DOES NOT require a treatment with an SCA at the initial fill. Commercial heavy-duty coolantlantifreeze that meets ASTM D4985" or ASTM D5345" specifications MAY require a treatment with an SCA at the initial fill. Read the label or the instructions that are provided by the OEM of the product.

In stationary engine applications and marine engine applications that do not require protection from boiling or freezing; a mixture of SCA and water is acceptable. Caterpillar recommends a minimum of six percent to a maximum of eight percent SCA concentration in those cooling systems: Distilled water or deionized water is preferred. Water which has the required properties may be used. For the water properties , see this publication; "General Coolant Information topic (Maintenance Section).

Note: Table 18 is a list of the coolants that are recommended and the service life (calendar) of the coolants. The service life of coolant is also limited by use (service hours). Refer to the specific engine's Operation and Maintenance Manual, "Maintenance Interval Schedule" (Maintenance Section). To achieve this service life, the coolants must be properly maintained. The maintenance program includes S.0.S coolant analysis.

## Extended Life Coolant (ELC)

SMCS Code: 1350; 1352; 1395

Caterpillar provides Extended Life Coolant (ELC) for use in the following applications:

- Heavy-duty spark ignited gas engines
- Heavy-duty diesel engines
- Automotive applications

The anti-corrosion package for Caterpillar ELC is different from the anti-corrosion package for other coolants: Caterpillar ELC is an ethylene glycol base coolant. However; Caterpillar ELC contains organic corrosion inhibitors and antifoam agents with low amounts of nitrite. Caterpillar ELC has been formulated with the correct amount of these additives in order to provide superior corrosion protection for all metals in engine cooling systems.

ELC extends the service life of the coolant to six years. The service life of coolant is also limited by use (service hours) Refer to the specific engine's Operation and Maintenance Manual, "Maintenance Interval Schedule" (Maintenance Section). ELC does not require frequent additions of a Supplemental Coolant Additive (SCA) An Extender is the only additional maintenance that is needed at three years or one half of the ELC service life.

premixed solution of ELC and distilled water is available in a 1:1 concentration.  The Premixed ELC provides freeze protection to ~36 'C (-33 The Premixed ELC is recommended for the initial fill of the cooling system. The Premixed ELC is also recommended for topping off the cooling system.

ELC Concentrate is also available. ELC Concentrate can be used to lower the freezing point to -51 '

Containers of several sizes are available. Consult your Caterpillar dealer for the part numbers.

Note: Caterpillar developed the EC-1 specification. The EC-1 specification is an industry standard.  The EC-1 specification defines all of the performance requirements that are needed for an engine coolant to be sold as an extended life coolant for Caterpillar engines; ELC can be used in most of the following types of engines: diesel, gasoline; and natural gas. ELC meets the performance requirements of ASTM D4985" and ASTM D5345" for heavy-duty low silicate coolantlantifreeze. ELC also meets the performance requirements of ASTM D3306" and ASTM D4656" for automotive applications.

## Extended Life Coolant (ELC) Cooling System Maintenance

SMCS Code: 1350; 1352; 1395

## Proper Additions to the Extended Life Coolant

## NOTICE

Use only Caterpillar products or commercial products that have passed Caterpillar's EC-1 specification for pre-mixed or concentrated coolants.

Use only   Caterpillar Extender with Extended Life Coolant.

Mixing Extended Life Coolant with other products reduces the Extended Life Coolant service life. Failure to follow the recommendations can reduce cooling system components life unless appropriate corrective action is performed.

In order to maintain the correct balance between the antifreeze and the additives; you must maintain the recommended concentration of Extended Life Coolant (ELC). Lowering the proportion of antifreeze lowers the proportion of additive. This will lower the ability of the coolant t0 protect the system from pitting; from cavitation; from erosion; and from deposits .

## NOTICE

Do not use a conventional coolant to top-off a cooling system that is filled with Extended Life Coolant (ELC).

Do not use standard supplemental coolant additive (SCA); Onlyuse ELC Extender in cooling systems that are filled with ELC.

During daily maintenance; use the premixed ELC as a cooling system top-off: This will bring the coolant up to the proper level. Use ELC or use a coolant that meets the Caterpillar EC-1 specification.

Before the engine is exposed to freezing temperatures; check the freeze protection (glycol concentration) of the coolant with the 1U-7298 CoolantBattery Tester (Celsius) or with the 1U-7297 Coolant/Battery Tester (Fahrenheit). Use ELC Concentrate to adjust the glycol concentration; if necessary. ELC Concentrate can be used to lower the

## Caterpillar ELC Extender

Caterpillar ELC Extender is added to the cooling system halfway through the ELC service life. Treat the cooling system with ELC Extender at three years or one half of the coolant service life. Refer to the specific engine's Operation and Maintenance Manual, Maintenance Interval Schedule' (Maintenance Section).

Containers of several sizes are available. Consult your Caterpillar dealer for the part numbers.

## Adding ELC Extender

The amount of ELC Extender that is required depends on the capacity of the cooling system: Use the equation that is in Table 19 in order to determine the proper amount of ELC Extender that is required.

Table 19

| Equation For Adding ELC Extender To ELC          |

## ELC Cooling System Cleaning

Note: If the cooling system is already using ELC, cleaning agents are not required to be used at the specified coolant change interval. Cleaning agents are only required if the system has been contaminated by the addition of some other type of coolant or by cooling system damage.

The ELC can be recycled. The drained coolant mixture can be distilled. The distillation process can remove the ethylene glycol and the water. Consult your Caterpillar dealer for more information:

After the cooling system is drained and refilled; operate the engine while the cooling system filler cap is removed. Operate the engine until the coolant level reaches the normal operating temperature and until the coolant level stabilizes. As needed, add the coolant mixture in order to fill the system to the proper level.

- 7 Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until the cooling system is completely clean.
- 8. Fill the cooling system with Caterpillar Premixed ELC.
- 'Label" to the filler of the cooling system in order to indicate the use of Caterpillar ELC.

Note: Clean water is the only flushing agent that is required when the ELC is drained from the cooling system:.

## Contamination of the ELC Cooling System

## NOTICE

Mixing ELC with other products reduces the effectiveness of the ELC and shortens the ELC service life. Use only Caterpillar products or commercial products that have passed the Caterpillar EC-1 specification for premixedor concentrate coolants. Use only Caterpillar ELC Extender with Caterpillar ELC. Failure to follow these recommendations can result in shortened cooling system component life.

ELC cooling systems can withstand contamination to a maximum of ten percent of conventional heavy-duty coolantlantifreeze or SCA. If the contamination exceeds ten percent of the total system capacity; perform ONE of the following procedures:

- Drain the cooling system into a suitable container. Dispose of the coolant according to local regulations. Flush the system with clean water. Fill the system with the Caterpillar ELC.
- Drain a portion of the cooling system into a suitable container according to local regulations. This should lower the contamination to less than 10 percent.
- Maintain the system as a conventional Diesel Engine AntifreezelCoolant (DEAC). Treat the system with an SCA. Change the coolant at the interval that is recommended for the conventional Diesel Engine AntifreezelCoolant (DEAC) .

## Commercial ELC

If Caterpillar ELC is not used, then select a commercial ELC that meets the Caterpillar specification of EC-1 and either the 'ASTM D5345" specification or the ASTM D4985" specification. Do not use an extended life coolant that does not meet the EC-1 specification. Follow the maintenance guide for the coolant from the supplier of the commercial ELC. Follow the Caterpillar guidelines for the quality of water and the specified coolant change interval.

## WaterlSupplemental Coolant Additive (SCA)

SMCS Code: 1350; 1352; 1395

## NOTICE

To help prevent water pump cavitation; Caterpillar recommends a minimum of 30 percent of glycol in the coolantantifreeze mixture.

Use a mixture that will provide protection against the lowest ambient temperature.

100 percent pure glycol will freeze at a temperature of ~13 'C (9 'F).

## NOTICE

Never use water alone without Supplemental Coolant Additives (SCA) or without inhibited coolant. Water alone is corrosive at engine operating temperatures. Water alone does not provide adequate protection against boiling or freezing:

Do not use water alone as an engine coolant. Supplemental Coolant Additive (SCA) helps to prevent the following conditions from occurring:

- Corrosion
- Formation of mineral deposits
- Cavitation of the cylinder liner
- Foaming of the coolant

If Caterpillar SCA is not used, select a commercial SCA. The commercial SCA must provide a minimum of 2400 mg/L or 2400 ppm (140 grains/US of nitrites in the final coolant mixture gal)

The quality of the water is a very important factor in this type of cooling system. Distilled water or deionized water is recommended for use in cooling systems. If distilled water or deionized water is not available; water that has the required properties may be used. For the water properties; see this Operation and Maintenance Manual, "General Coolant Information' topic (Maintenance Section).

cooling system that uses a mixture of only SCA and water requires more SCA than a cooling system and water requires six to eight percent of SCA.

## Adding the SCA to Water at the Initial Fill

The capacity of the cooling system determines the amount of SCA that is required. Use the equation that is in Table 26 to determine the amount of Caterpillar SCA that is required at the initial fill. This equation is for a mixture of only SCA and water.

## S.0.S Coolant Analysis

SMCS Code: 1350; 1352; 1395

Testing the engine coolant is important to ensure that the engine is protected from internal cavitation and from corrosion. The analysis also tests the ability of the coolant to protect the engine from boiling and from freezing:

Coolant analysis can be performed at your Caterpillar dealership. Caterpillar's S-O-S coolant analysis is an excellent way to monitor the condition of your coolant and your cooling system:

The most critical aspect of coolant analysis is the interpretation of the results. The analyst must be properly trained in order to provide a correct diagnosis. The analyst must understand several variables.

Different coolants have different formulations and different condemning limits. Different commercial same variable. These other considerations are also important for interpreting the results of a coolant analysis:

- The number of hours on the sample
- The equipment that uses the coolant
- The application of the equipment

Analysts at Caterpillar's S-O-S fluid labs are trained to determine the acceptability of coolants.  These analysts have knowledge of the equipment and applications. These qualifications enable the analysts to detect problems before damage occurs.

## NOTICE

Do not use the same vacuum sampling pump for extracting oil samples that is used for extracting coolant samples.

A small residue of either type sample may remain in the pump and may cause a false positive analysis for the sample being taken.

Always use a designated pump for oil sampling and a designated pump for coolant sampling.

Failure to do so may cause a false analysis which could lead to customer and dealer concerns.

Caterpillar's S-O.S coolant analysis is a program with two levels. The program is based on periodic samples. The samples are analyzed. The results are reported; and appropriate recommendations are made according to the results.

## S.0.S Coolant Analysis (Level I)

A coolant analysis (Level I) is a test of the properties of the coolant that includes the following items:

- Glycol concentration for protection from boiling and freezing
- Ability to protect from erosion and corrosion
- pH
- Conductivity
- Water hardness
- Visual analysis
- Analysis of the odor

The results are reported, and appropriate recommendations are made.

## S.0.S Coolant Analysis (Level II)

A coolant analysis (Level Il) is a comprehensive chemical evaluation of the coolant. This analysis is also a check of the overall condition of the inside of the cooling system:  The following services are provided:

- Full Level analysis
- Identification of the source of metal corrosion and of contaminants
- Identification of buildup of the impurities that cause corrosion
- Identification of buildup of the impurities that cause scaling
- Determination of possible electrolysis within the engines' cooling system

The results are reported, and appropriate recommendations are made.

For more information on S-0-S coolant analysis; consult your Caterpillar dealer.

## Maintenance Recommendations

## General Maintenance Information

SMCS Code: 4450; 7000

Note: Read the warnings and read the instructions that are contained in the Safety Section of this manual. These warnings and instructions must be understood before you perform any operation or any maintenance procedures.

Rotating electric machines are complex structures that are exposed to the following forms of stress:

- mechanical
- electrical
- thermal
- environmental

These stresses may be of varying magnitudes. The insulation systems are very susceptible to damage that is caused by the stresses that are listed above. Exposure to these stresses may shorten the effective life of the insulation system. Therefore; the service life of an electric machine will largely depend on the serviceability of the insulation systems. An inspection program and a testing procedure are recommended. An inspection program and a testing procedure will ensure that the equipment is maintained in satisfactory condition. This will increase field reliability.

A regular maintenance and inspection program can provide an evaluation of the present condition of the equipment. A regular maintenance program and a regular inspection program can also reveal future problems. The frequency of this maintenance program will depend on the following factors:

- application
- environmental conditions
- operator's experience
- operator's philosophy

A regular maintenance program is strongly recommended.  This program would involve the following steps:

- periodic disassembly

i01135057

- knowledgeable visual examination of the equipment
- the application of electrical tests

Never perform a test over the rated potential.  These tests can damage insulation that is contaminated or insulation that is in marginal condition. For more consult a Caterpillar dealer.

## Space Heaters

The SRAB generator is capable of operating in high humidity conditions without problems. However; problems can occur when the generator is idle and the surrounding air is warmer than the generator Moisture can form on the windings that will result in poor performance from the windings. Moisture can also result in damage to the windings: Whenever the generator is not active; ensure that the space heaters are in operation:

Whenever the generator is operating; ensure that the space heaters are disconnected.

An external source of either 115 VAC or 230 VAC is required to operate the space heaters.

<!-- image -->

Illustration 76

Space heater connection to external source (H1), (H2), (H3), and (H4) terminals.

If a 115 VAC source is available; connect both heaters in parallel across the source. If a 230 VAC source is available; connect both heaters in series across the source. Refer to Illustration 76.

## Alternator Inspect

SMCS Code: 1405-040

Caterpillar recommends a scheduled inspection connections and proper battery charging. Inspect the ammeter (if equipped) during engine operation in order to ensure proper battery performance andlor proper performance of the electrical system. Make repairs, as required. Refer to the Service Manual.

Check the alternator and the battery charger for proper operation. If the batteries are properly charged, the ammeter reading should be very near zero All batteries should be kept charged. The batteries should be kept warm because temperature affects the cranking power. If the battery is too cold; the battery will not crank the engine.  The battery will not crank the engine; even if the engine is warm. When the engine is not run for long periods of time or if the engine is run for short periods; the batteries may not fully charge: A battery with a low charge will freeze more easily than a battery with a full charge.

## Alternator and Fan Belts InspectAdjustReplace

SMCS Code: 1357-025; 1357-040; 1357-510; 1405

## Inspection

Inspect the alternator belt and the fan drive belts for wear and for cracking. Replace the belts if the belts are not in good condition.

Check the belt tension according to the information in the Service Manual, Specifications'

Slippage of loose belts can reduce the efficiency of the driven components. Vibration of loose belts can cause unnecessary wear on the following components:

- Belts
- Pulleys
- Bearings

If the belts are too tight; unnecessary stress is placed on the components. This reduces the service life of the components.

## Replacement

For applications that require multiple drive belts; replace the drive belts in matched sets. Replacing one drive belt of a matched set will cause the new drive belt to carry more load because the older drive belts are stretched. The additional load on the new drive belt could cause the new drive belt to fail.

## Bearing Inspect

## SMCS Code: 4471-040

The following. maintenance procedure for generator bearings should be followed at every major engine overhaul:

- 1. Remove the bearing bracket.  Inspect the following items: bracket bore, bearing outer race, and rolling elements. On Standby Power Units; the bearing must be inspected and the grease must be replaced at three year intervals. The bearing bracket sleeve should be inspected for out of roundness, excessive wear; and a bracket step that is less than 0.0762 mm (0.0030 inch). If there is no bearing bracket sleeve; inspect the bearing bracket bore. The bearing should be inspected for outer race damage; severe fretting, and smoothness of operation:. When possible the bearing elements should be inspected. Some double-shielded ball bearings prevent visual inspection of the ball bearing elements. Other double shielded ball bearings have a retaining This retaining ring can be removed in order to allow access for a visual inspection of the ball bearing elements.

On two-bearing generators; the front bearing can only be removed after the hub is removed: In order to remove the hub, cut off the hub. Pulling the hub will damage the shaft.

Note: Bearings that are being removed for failure analysis should not be cut off with a torch.

- 2\_ Spherical Roller Bearing should be cleaned and repacked with 108-8611 Grease Pack the bearing and pack the cavity (one-third to one-half of the cavity volume) The bearing should be filled with 88.8 mL (3 ounces) to 118.4 mL (4 ounces) of grease. The cavity should be filled with 118.4 mL (4 ounces) to 148.0 mL (5 ounces) of grease. Refer to Table 44.
- 3. All ball bearings should be cleaned.  The bracket cavity should be repacked with 28-3230 Grease. Pack the bearings (one-third to one-half of the cavity volume). Refer to Table 44.

## Cooling System Water Temperature Regulator Replace

SMCS Code: 1355-510

Replace the water temperature regulator before the water temperature regulator fails. This is a recommended preventive maintenance practice. Replacing the water temperature regulator reduces the chances for unscheduled downtime.

A water temperature regulator that fails in a partially opened position can cause overheating or overcooling of the engine.

A water temperature regulator that fails in the closed position can cause excessive overheating. Excessive overheating could result in cracking of the cylinder head or piston seizure problems.

A water temperature regulator that fails in the open position will cause the engine operating temperature to be too low during partial load operation: Low engine operating temperatures during partial loads could cause an excessive carbon buildup inside the cylinders. This excessive carbon buildup could result in an accelerated wear of the piston rings and wear of the cylinder liner

## NOTICE

Failure to replace your water temperature regulator on a regularly scheduled basis could cause severe engine damage.

Caterpillar engines incorporate a shunt design cooling system and require operating the engine with a water temperature regulator installed.

If the water temperature regulator is installed incorrectly, the engine may overheat; causing cylinder head damage. Ensure that the new water temperature regulator is installed in the original position. Ensure that the water temperature regulator vent hole is open:

Do not use liquid gasket material on the gasket or cylinder head surface:

Refer to the Service Manual for the replacement procedure of the water temperature regulator; or consult your Caterpillar dealer.

Note: If only the water temperature regulators are replaced, drain the coolant from the cooling system to a level that is below the water temperature regulator housing:

## Crankshaft Vibration Damper Inspect

SMCS Code: 1205-040

The crankshaft vibration damper limits the torsional vibration of the crankshaft. The visconic damper has a weight that is located inside a fluid filled case.

Damage to the crankshaft vibration damper or failure of the damper can increase torsional vibrations. This can result in damage to the crankshaft and to other engine components. A deteriorating damper can cause excessive gear train noise at variable points in the speed range.

A damper that is hot may be the result of excessive friction. This could be due to misalignment: Use an infrared thermometer to monitor the temperature of the damper during operation: If the temperature reaches 93 'C (200 'F), consult your Caterpillar dealer.

Inspect the damper for evidence of dents; cracks, and leaks of the fluid.

If a fluid leak is found, determine the type of fluid. The fluid in the damper is silicone. Silicone has the following characteristics: transparent, viscous, smooth; and difficult to remove from surfaces.

If the fluid leak is oil, inspect the crankshaft seals for leaks. If a leak is observed, replace all of the seals.

Inspect the damper and repair or replace the damper for any of the following reasons.

- The damper is dented; cracked, or leaking.
- The on the damper is discolored from heat. paint
- The engine has had a failure because of a broken crankshaft.
- An analysis of the oil has revealed that the front bearing of the crankshaft is badly worn.
- There is a large amount of gear train wear that is not caused by a lack of oil.

## Fuel Tank Water and Sediment Drain

SMCS Code: 1273-543-M&amp;S

## Fuel Tank

Fuel quality is critical to the performance and to the service life of the engine Water in the fuel can occurs during the heating and cooling of fuel. The condensation occurs as the fuel passes through the fuel system and the fuel returns to the fuel tank. This causes water to accumulate in fuel tanks. Draining the fuel tank regularly and obtaining fuel from reliable sources can help to eliminate water in the fuel.

## Drain the Water and the Sediment

Fuel tanks should contain some provision for draining water and draining sediment from the bottom of the fuel tanks.

Open the drain valve on the bottom of the fuel tank in order to drain the water and the sediment. Close the drain valve

Check the fuel daily. Drain the water and sediment from the fuel tank after operating the engine or drain the water and sediment from the fuel tank after the fuel tank has been filled. Allow five to ten minutes before performing this procedure.

Fill the fuel tank after operating the engine in order to drive out moist air  This will help prevent condensation. Do not fill the tank to the The fuel expands as the fuel gets warm.  The tank overflow. top. may

Some fuel tanks use supply pipes that allow water and sediment to settle below the end of the fuel supply pipe. Some fuel tanks use supply lines that take fuel directly from the bottom of the tank: If the engine is equipped with this system; regular maintenance of the fuel system filter is important.

## Fuel Storage Tanks

Drain the water and the sediment from the fuel storage tank during the following conditions:

- Weekly
- Oil change
- Refill of the tank

This will help prevent water or sediment from being pumped from the storage tank into the engine fuel tank.

If a bulk storage tank has been refilled or moved recently; allow adequate time for the sediment to settle before filling the engine fuel tank. Internal baffles in the bulk storage tank will also help trap sediment.  Filtering fuel that is pumped from the storage tank helps to ensure the quality of the fuel. When possible; water separators should be used.

Personal injury or death can result from improper troubleshooting and repair procedures.

The following troubleshooting and repair procedures should only be performed by qualified personnel familiar with this equipment.

Refer to Safety Section; "Generator Isolating fo Maintenance' for information regarding the procedure to safely isolate the generator.

If the insulation resistance values are less than the recommended values; one of the following drying procedures must be selected This decision should be based on the following factors:

- the size of the unit
- the location of the unit
- the equipment that is available

- the experience of personnel

Note: For more information on drying methods; refer to Special Instruction; SEHS9124, "Cleaning and Drying of Electric Set Generators'

Remove the voltage regulator: Cover all of the inlet openings. Cover all of the discharge holes. Provide an opening at the top of the machine. This opening will allow moisture to evaporate. Preferably; this opening will be located at the fan end. Monitor the winding temperatures. DO NOT APPLY HEAT TOO RAPIDLY: Winding temperature should be raised gradually at a rate of 10 'C (50 %F) per hour up to 85 'C (185 Measure insulation resistance at one hour intervals. Typically; the insulation resistance will slowly drop while the temperature is rising.  The insulation resistance will then start to increase at a slow rate until the insulation resistance reaches a constant level. PF).

The following methods can be used for drying a generator:

- Self-circulating air method
- Oven method
- Controlled current method

## Self-Circulating Air Method

Run the engine and disconnect the generator load. This will help circulate air. Operate the generator space heaters.

## Oven Method

## WARNING

Personal injury or death can result from improper troubleshooting and repair procedures.

The tollowing troubleshooting and repair procedures should only be performed by qualified personnel familiar with this equipment.

Refer to Safety Section; Generator Isolating for Maintenance" for information regarding the procedure to safely isolate the generator

Proper maintenance of electrical equipment requires periodic visual examination of the generator and periodic visual examination of the windings. Proper maintenance of electrical equipment also requires appropriate electrical checks and appropriate thermal checks. Insulation material should be examined for cracks. The insulation material should be examined for accumulations of dirt and dust. If there is an insulation resistance value that is below normal, a conductive path may be present. This conductive path may be made of one of the following materials:

- Carbon
- Salt
- Metal dust
- Dirt that is saturated with moisture

These contaminants will develop a conductive path which may produce shorts: Cleaning is advisable if heavy accumulations of dirt can be seen or if heavy accumulations of dust can be seen. If excess dirt is the cause of a restriction in the ventilation; cleaning is also advisable. Restricted ventilation will cause excessive heating:

## NOTICE

To avoid the possibility of deterioration to the genera tor windings; do not clean the generator unless there is visual, electrical, or thermal evidence that dirt is present.

If harmful dirt accumulations are present; a variety of cleaning techniques are available.  The cleaning procedure that is used may be determined by one of the items on the following list:

- The extent of the cleaning procedure that is being attempted
- The type of enclosure of the generator
- The voltage rating of the generator
- The type of dirt that is removed being

## Cleaning (Assembled Generators)

Cleaning may be required at the point of installation. At this point; complete disassembly of the generator may not be necessary or feasible In this case; a vacuum cleaner should be used to pick up the following items: dirt, dust, and carbon. This will prevent the spreading of these contaminants. dry

A small nonconductive tube may need to be connected to the vacuum cleaner.  This will allow the vacuum cleaner to clean the surfaces that are not exposed. After most of the dust has been removed, a small brush may be attached to the vacuum hose in order to loosen dirt that is more firmly attached to the surface.

After the initial cleaning with a vacuum; compressed air may be used to remove the remaining dust and dirt: Compressed air that is used for cleaning should be free of moisture and of oil. Air pressure should be a maximum of 210 kPa (30 psi) in order to prevent mechanical damage to the insulation. If the above cleaning procedures are not effective; consult a Caterpillar dealer. free

## Cleaning (Disassembled Generators)

An initial insulation resistance check should be made on the generator in order to confirm electrical integrity: A minimum reading of one megohm would be expected with severely contaminated generators. A zero megohm reading may indicate an insulation breakdown. An insulation breakdown requires more than cleaning. An insulation breakdown requires repair.

high pressure wash is normally an effective way to clean windings. This includes windings that have been exposed to flooding or windings that have been contaminated by salt. A solution of hot water and detergent is used for this method of cleaning.

high pressure wash sprays a high velocity fluid stream of this solution over the generator that is being cleaned. This detergent washing is followed by multiple sprays of clean water.  The clean water is used in order to remove the detergent or the clean water is used in order to dilute the detergent:.

Allow the generator to dry at room temperature. Check the insulation resistance. The insulation resistance should now be normal. If the insulation resistance is not normal, repeat the procedure. It may be necessary to use solvents if the generator is contaminated with oil or if the generator is contaminated with grease.

Note: For more information on drying methods; refer to Special Instructions; SEHS9124, 'Cleaning and Drying of Electric Set Generators'

i01473721

## Generator Load Check

SMCS Code: 4450-535-LA

During normal operation; monitor the power factor and monitor generator loading:

When a generator is installed or when a generator is reconnected, ensure that the total current in any one phase does not exceed the nameplate rating. Each phase should carry the same load. This allows the generator to work at the rated capacity: If one phase current exceeds the nameplate amperage; an electrical imbalance will occur. An electrical imbalance can result in an electrical overload and an electrical imbalance can result in overheating.

The power factor can be referred to as the efficiency of the load. This can be expressed as the ratio of kVA to actual kW. The power factor can be calculated by dividing kW by kVA. Power factor is expressed as a decimal. Power factor is used to mean the portion of current that is supplied to a system that is doing useful work.  The portion of the current that is not doing useful work is absorbed in maintaining the magnetic field in motors. This current (reactive load) can be maintained without engine power.

Electric sets normally have a low idle setting that is higher than industrial engines. Low idle will be approximately 66 percent of the full speed that is achieved by 60 Hz units. This would be equal to 80 percent of the full speed that is achieved by 50 Hz units.

Some electric sets are equipped with Woodward governors and some electric sets are equipped with Caterpillar electronic governors. These electric sets have no low idle stop. On electric sets with mechanical governors and natural gas electric sets; the low idle is set at the factory: Adjustment of the low idle on these machines should only be done by a Caterpillar dealer.

Note: Operating the electric set at low idle speed for an extended time will cause some voltage regulators to shut off: The electric set must be completely shut down and the electric set must be restarted. This will allow the voltage regulator to produce an output. again

| 9U-6003        | Insulation Testing Gp |                |

Periodically; use an insulation tester to check the insulation resistance of the generator's main stator winding: The frequency of this test is determined by the generator's environment. Previous insulation tester readings will also determine the frequency of this test.

Test the main stator windings with an insulation tester in the following situations:

- The generator set is started for the first time.
- The generator set is removed from storage.
- The generator set is operating in a humid
- The generator set is not protected from the elements in an enclosed area. Test every three months.
- The generator set is installed in an enclosed area. This area needs to be low in humidity and this area needs to have steady temperatures. Test every twelve months (minimum).

- The generator set has not been run under load for three months. Test the generator set weekly: Use space heaters around the generator set if the generator is exposed to a sea water environment or if the humidity is above 75 percent. Also use space heaters if a test result was below 3 megohms.
- Space heaters must be used whenever the generator set is not under Ioad. Space heaters must also be used whenever salt is present or whenever high humidity is present.  Using a space heater in this fashion is the only way to maintain insulation tester readings above one megohm: Use space heaters only when the generator is not running:

## WARNING

Personal injury or death can result from electrocution.

The megohmmeter is applying a high voltage to the circuit.

To avoid electrocution, do not touch the instrument leads without first discharging them. When finished   testing also discharge the   generator windings.

- 1. Take the generator out of service.
- 2. Visually inspect the generator for moisture. Jf moisture exists, do not perform this insulation test the unit first. Refer to Special Instruction; SEHS9124, "Cleaning and Drying of Electric Set Generators' Dry
- 3. Inspect the installation: Determine the equipment that will be tested by the insulation tester.
- 4. Discharge the capacitance of the windings.
- 5. Disconnect "TO" from ground.
- 6. Disconnect the regulator sensing lead wires: "20" and "24"
- Connect the insulation tester's RED lead to ground.
- 8. Connect the insulation tester's BLACK lead to "To'
- 9 For units that are 600 volts or less; set the voltage to 500 Volts. For units that are more than 600 volts; set the voltage to 1000 Volts.
- 10. Use the 30/60 Time Resistance Method:
- a. Apply voltage.
- b. Observe the readings at 30 seconds. Observe the readings at 60 seconds.
- C. Record the 60 second reading: This reading must be corrected for temperature.
- d. Record temperature.
- e. Record humidity:
- f. Remove voltage.
- Evaluate the readings.  The actual value of the resistance may vary greatly between generators. For this reason, the insulation's condition must be evaluated. Base this evaluation on the comparison between the 60 second resistance readings and the readings that were taken on previous dates.  These two readings must be taken under similar conditions. If a 60 second resistance reading has a 50 percent reduction from the previous reading; the insulation may have absorbed too much moisture. 11.

Switch the insulation tester to the "OFF' position: This will discharge the insulation tester's leads. Disconnect the insulation tester's leads.

Note: The results from the insulation resistance checks indicate when cleaning andlor repairing is becoming critical.  Generally; insulation resistance will vary greatly with temperature.   Therefore, always to Illustration 109.

- Fuel consumption is based on a load factor of approximately 60 percent.

## Severe Operation

Severe operation is the use of an engine that exceeds current published standards for that engine. Caterpillar maintains standards for the following engine parameters:

- Horsepower
- Range of rpm
- Fuel consumption
- Fuel quality
- Altitude
- Maintenance intervals
- Selection of oil
- Selection of coolant
- Environmental qualities

- Installation

Refer to the standards for your engine or consult your Caterpillar dealer in order to determine if your engine is operating within the defined parameters .

Severe operation can accelerate component wear: Engines that are operating under severe conditions may need more frequent maintenance intervals for the following reasons:

- Maximum reliability
- Retention of full service life

Because of individual applications, it is not possible to identify all of the factors which can contribute to severe operation. Consult your Caterpillar dealer about the maintenance that is needed for specific engine. your

The following factors can contribute to severe operation: environment; improper operating procedures; and improper maintenance practices.

## Environmental Factors

## Extreme Ambient Temperatures

Extended operation in environments that are extremely cold or hot can damage components. Valve components can be damaged by carbon buildup if the engine is frequently started and in stopped very cold temperatures. Extremely hot inlet air reduces the performance capabilities of the engine.

Note: Refer to this Operation and Maintenance Manual , "Cold Weather Operations" topic in or refer to Supplement; SEBU5898, "Cold Weather Recommendations'

## Cleanliness

Unless the equipment is cleaned regularly; extended operation in a dirty environment and in a dusty environment can damage components. Built up mud, dirt, and dust can encase components. This can make maintenance difficult. The buildup can contain corrosive chemicals. Corrosive chemicals and salt can damage some components.

## Altitude

Engines are set to operate within a certain altitude. Operating above this altitude can cause engine damage. Adjustments are necessary for operation at higher altitudes.

## Improper Operating Procedures

- Extended operation at low idle
- Minimum cool down periods after high load factor operation
- Operating the engine at loads that are greater than the rated load
- Operating the engine at speeds that are greater than the rated speed
- Use of the engine for an application that is not approved

## Improper Maintenance Practices

- Extension of maintenance intervals
- Not using recommended fuel, lubricants; and coolantlantifreeze

## Overhaul (Major)

SMCS Code: 7595-020-MJ

The maintenance intervals that are listed in this Operation and Maintenance Manual, "Maintenance Interval Schedule" are expressed in service hours. A more accurate figure to use is fuel consumption. Fuel consumption corresponds more accurately to the engine load.

Table 51 lists average ranges of fuel consumption and service hours for a load factor of approximately 60 percent. Use the range of fuel consumption only as a guideline.

- 1) Fuel consumption is based on a load factor of approximately 60 percent.

The need for a major overhaul is determined by several factors:

- An increase in oil consumption

- An increase in crankcase blowby
- The total amount of fuel consumption
- The service hours of the engine
- The wear metal analysis of the lube oil
- An increase in the levels of noise and vibration

An increase of wear metals in the lube oil indicates that the bearings and the surfaces that wear may need to be serviced. An increase in the levels of noise and vibration indicates that rotating parts require service.

Note: It is possible for oil analysis to indicate a decrease of wear metals in the lube oil. The cylinder liners may be worn so that polishing of the bore occurs. Also; the increased use of lube oil will dilute the wear metals.

Monitor the engine as the engine accumulates service hours. Consult your Caterpillar dealer about scheduling a major overhaul.

Note: The driven equipment may also require service when the engine is overhauled. Refer to the literature that is provided by the OEM of the driven equipment.

A major overhaul includes all of the work that is done for the top end overhaul. A major overhaul includes additional parts and labor. Additional parts and labor are required in order to completely rebuild the engine.

For the major overhaul, all of the bearings; seals; gaskets; and components that wear are disassembled. The parts are cleaned and The crankshaft is measured for wear. The crankshaft may require regrinding: Alternatively; the crankshaft may be replaced with a Caterpillar replacement part.

Your Caterpillar dealer can provide these services and components. Your Caterpillar dealer can ensure that the components are operating within the appropriate specifications.

The following definitions explain the terminology for the services that are performed during an overhaul:

Inspect Inspect the components according to the instructions that are in Caterpillar reusability publications. Refer to Guidelines for Reusable Parts and Salvage Operations; SEBF8029, "Index of Publications on Reusability or Salvage of Used Parts' The guidelines were developed in order to help Caterpillar dealers and customers avoid unnecessary expenditures. New parts are not required if the existing parts can still be used, reconditioned, or repaired. If the components are not in the reusability guidelines; refer to the Service Manual, "Specifications' module.

Rebuild The component can be reconditioned in order to comply with reusability guidelines.

Replace The service life of the is exhausted. The part fail before the next maintenance interval: The part must be replaced with a part that meets functional specifications.  The replacement part may be a new part; a CAT remanufactured part; a rebuilt part, or a used part. Some worn components may be exchanged with your Caterpillar dealer for credit on replacement parts.

## Overhaul Considerations

SMCS Code: 7595-043

## Overhaul Information

An overhaul is replacing the major worn components of the engine. An overhaul interval is a maintenance interval that is planned. The engine is rebuilt with certain rebuilt parts or new that replace the worn parts parts .

- Inspection of all the that are visible during the disassembly parts
- Replacement of the seals and gaskets that are removed
- Cleaning of the internal passages of the engine and the engine block

Most owners will save money by overhauling the engine at the intervals that are recommended in this Operation and Maintenance Manual. Consider the graph in Illustration 110.

<!-- image -->

## Illustration 110

900745964

Cost

Time

Cost of maintenance and repair that is planned

Cost of maintenance and repair that is not planned

In Illustration 110, line (1) represents the maintenance and repair costs for an owner that followed the recommendations for inspection; maintenance; and repair,  The peaks represent overhauls.

Line (2) represents the maintenance and repair costs for an owner that chose to operate beyond the recommended intervals. The initial cost of the "repair-after-failure' philosophy is lower. Also; the first overhaul was delayed. 'However; the peaks are significantly higher than the peaks for the customer that used the "repair-before-failure" philosophy

The higher peaks result from two factors: key

- Delaying an overhaul until a breakdown increases the chance of a catastrophic failure. This type of failure requires more parts; labor; and cleanup.
- Excessive wear means that fewer components will be reusable. More labor may be required for

When all of the costs are considered, "REPAIR-BEFORE-FAILURE' is the least expensive alternative for most components and engines.

It is not practical to wait until the engine exhibits symptoms of excessive wear or failure. It is not less costly to wait. A planned overhaul before failure may be the best value for the following reasons:

- Costly unplanned downtime can be avoided.
- Many original parts can be reused according to the guidelines for reusable parts:.
- The service life of the engine can be extended without the risk of a major catastrophe due to engine failure.
- Achieve the best costlvalue relationship per hour of extended service life.

## Overhaul Intervals

Some factors that are important for determining the overhaul intervals include the following considerations:

- Performance of preventive maintenance
- Use of recommended lubricants
- Use of recommended coolants
- Use of recommended fuels
- Proper installation
- Operating conditions
- Operation within acceptable limits
- Engine load
- Engine speed

Generally; engines that are operated at a reduced load andlor speed achieve more service life before an overhaul. However; this is for engines that are properly operated and maintained.

Other factors must also be considered for determining a major overhaul:

- The total amount of fuel consumption
- The service hours of the engine
- An increase of oil consumption
- An increase of crankcase blowby
- The wear metal analysis of the lube oil
- An increase in the levels of noise and vibration

An increase of wear metals in the lube oil indicates that the bearings and the surfaces that wear may need to be serviced. An increase in the levels of noise and vibration indicates that rotating parts require service

Note: It is possible for oil analysis to indicate a decrease of wear metals in the lube oil. The cylinder liners may be worn so that polishing of the bore Also; the increased use of lube oil will dilute occurs. the wear metals.

accumulates Monitor the engine as the service hours. Consult your Caterpillar dealer about scheduling a major overhaul. engine may also require Note: The driven equipment the service when the engine is overhauled. Refer to literature that is provided by the OEM of the driven equipment.

## For Calculating the Using Fuel Consumption Overhaul Intervals

fuel consumption is the most important The total overhaul interval. Fuel factor for estimating the consumption compensates for the application and for the engine load.

If the total fuel consumption has not been recorded, use the equation in Table 55 in order to estimate the until the overhaul. The equation may also be hours used to estimate overhaul intervals for new engines.

| "P"is the estimated total amount of fuel consumption of the engine.        |
| "R" is the rate of fuel consumption in liters per hour or gallons per hour |

Use the actual records of fuel consumption; when possible. If the actual records are not available; use the following procedure in order to estimate the fuel consumption.

- 1. operation of the engine:
- 2 Refer to the engine's Caterpillar  "Engine Specifications' spec' sheet) . This will determine the fuel consumption for the percent of the Ioad that was estimated in Step 1. Use this figure for the equation in Table 55.

## Oil Consumption as an Overhaul Indicator

and Oil consumption; fuel   consumption; estimate maintenance information can be used to the total operating cost for your Caterpillar engine Oil consumption can also be used to estimate the required capacity of a makeup oil tank that is suitable for the maintenance intervals.

Oil consumption is in proportion to the percentage of the rated engine load. As the percentage of the engine load is increased; the amount of oil that is consumed per hour also increases.

The oil consumption rate (brake specific oil consumption) is measured in grams per kWh (Ib per bhp) The brake specific oil consumption (BSOC) depends on the engine load: Consult your Caterpillar dealer for assistance in determining the typical oil consumption rate for your engine.

When an engine's oil consumption has risen to three times the original oil consumption rate due t0 normal wear; an engine overhaul should be scheduled. There may be a corresponding increase in blowby and a slight increase in fuel consumption

For maximum engine service life; make a thorough inspection of the engine compartment before starting the engine Look for items such as oil leaks or coolant leaks, loose bolts, worn belts, loose connections and trash buildup. Make repairs, as needed:

- The guards must be in the proper place. Repair damaged guards or replace missing guards.
- Wipe all caps and plugs before the engine is serviced in order to reduce the chance of system contamination.

## NOTICE

For any type of leak (coolant; lube; or fuel) clean up the fluid. If leaking is observed, find the source andcorrect the leak. If leaking is suspected, check the fluid levels more often than recommended until the leak is found or fixed, or until the suspicion of a leak is proved to be unwarranted.

## NOTICE

Accumulated grease andlor oil on an engine or deck is a fire hazard. Remove this debris with steam cleaning or high pressure water.

- Ensure that cooling lines are properly clamped. Check for leaks. Check the condition of all pipes.
- Inspect the water pump for coolant leaks.

Note: The water pump seal is lubricated by coolant in the cooling system: It is normal for a small amount of leakage to occur as the engine cools down and the parts contract.

Excessive coolant leakage may indicate the need to replace the water pump seal. For the removal of water pump and the installation of water pump andlor seals, refer to the Service Manual for the engine or consult your Caterpillar dealer.

- Inspect the lubrication system for leaks at the front crankshaft seal, the rear crankshaft seal, the oil pan; the oil filters and the valve cover.
- Inspect the fuel system for leaks. Look for loose fuel line clamps.
- Inspect the piping for the air inlet system and the elbows for cracks and for loose clamps.
- Inspect the alternator belt and the accessory drive belts for cracks; breaks or other damage.

Belts for multiple groove pulleys must be replaced as matched sets. If only one belt is replaced, the belt will carry more load than the belts that are not replaced. The older belts are stretched.  The additional load on the new belt could cause the belt to break.

- Drain the water and the sediment from fuel tanks on a daily basis in order to ensure that only clean fuel enters the fuel system.
- Inspect the wiring and the wiring harnesses for loose connections and for worn wires or frayed wires.
- Inspect the ground strap for a good connection and for good condition
- Inspect the engine-to-frame ground strap for a good connection and for good condition.

## Zinc Rods InspectReplace

SMCS Code: 1388-040; 1388-510

Corrosion in sea water circuits can result in premature deterioration of cooling system components; leaks; and possible cooling system contamination. The corrosion may be caused by the lack of zinc rods in the sea water system.

Zinc rods are installed in the sea water cooling system of the engine in order to help prevent the corrosive oxidation that is caused by sea water. Electrical current is conducted through the contact of the zinc rods with the cooling system components. The zinc rods oxidize rather than the cooling system components. Rapid deterioration of zinc rods may indicate the presence of uncontrolled electrical currents from improperly installed electrical attachments or improperly grounded electrical attachments.

The engineer for the operation must determine the interval for inspecting the zinc rods. The interval for inspecting the zinc rods will depend on the size of the zinc rods and the number of zinc rods that are installed.

For the location of the zinc rods, see the literature that is provided by the OEM of the installation.

## Inspect the Zinc Rods

- 1. Remove the zinc rod.
- 2. Inspect the zinc rod.

Ensure that the zinc rod will remain effective until the next scheduled inspection.

- a. If the zinc rod has deteriorated excessively; install a new zinc rod.
- b. Tap the zinc rod lightly with a hammer: If the zinc rod breaks, install a new zinc rod.
- 3 If the zinc rod will be reused; scrape the layer of oxidation from the zinc rod before installation. The layer of oxidation reduces the effectiveness of the zinc rod.
